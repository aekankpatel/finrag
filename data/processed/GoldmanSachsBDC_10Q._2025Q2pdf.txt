CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the 
use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “target,” “estimate,” “intend,” 
“continue” or “believe” or the negatives of, or other variations on, these terms or comparable terminology. You should read statements 
that contain these words carefully because they discuss our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations concerning our business, 
operating results, financial condition and other similar matters. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to 
our investors. Our forward-looking statements include information in this report regarding general domestic and global economic 
conditions, our future financing plans, our ability to operate as a business development company (“BDC”) and the expected performance 
of, and the yield on, our portfolio companies. There may be events in the future, however, that we are not able to predict accurately or 
control. The factors listed under “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as well as any 
cautionary language in this report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially 
from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and 
elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Any forward-
looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date of this report. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to 
differ from our forward-looking statements may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We 
undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events 
or otherwise, except as required by law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through 
reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including annual 
reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The safe 
harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which preclude civil liability 
for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this quarterly report because we are an 
investment company. The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking 
statements:
•
our future operating results; 
•
disruptions in the capital markets, market conditions, and general economic uncertainty;
•
changes in political, economic, social or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial 
and capital markets, including the effect of any pandemic or epidemic;
•
United States trade policy developments, tariffs and other trade restrictions;
•
uncertainty surrounding the financial and political stability of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union 
and China, the war between Russia and Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East; 
•
our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 
•
the impact of investments that we expect to make; 
•
the impact of increased competition; 
•
our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties, including our ability to enter into transactions involving 
derivatives and contracting with certain investors; 
•
the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; 
•
the ability of our current and prospective portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 
•
the relative and absolute performance of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (the “Investment Adviser”); 
•
the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments; 
•
our ability to make distributions; 
•
the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; 
•
changes in interest rates; 
•
the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; 
•
the impact of future acquisitions and divestitures; 
•
the effect of changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations thereof; 

3
 
 
•
our ability to maintain our status as a BDC;
•
our ability to maintain our status under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) as a 
regulated investment company (“RIC”) and our qualification for tax treatment as a RIC; 
•
actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Investment Adviser and its affiliates; 

Table of Contents

•
general price and volume fluctuations in the stock market; 
•
the ability of the Investment Adviser to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 
•
the impact on our business from new or amended legislation or regulations; 
•
the availability of credit and/or our ability to access the equity and capital markets; 
•
currency fluctuations, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. 
dollars; 
•
the impact of changing inflation and interest rates and the risk of recession on our portfolio companies;
•
the effect of global climate change on our portfolio companies; 
•
purchases of our common stock pursuant to any 10b5-1 plan or otherwise may result in the price of our common stock being 
higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market;
•
purchases of our common stock by us under any 10b5-1 plan or otherwise may result in dilution to our net asset value 
("NAV") per share;
•
the impact of information technology system failures, data security breaches, data privacy compliance, network disruptions, 
and cybersecurity attacks; and
•
the increased public scrutiny of and regulation related to corporate social responsibility.

Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. 
Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of June 30, 2025 (continued)
(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
(Unaudited)
(1)
Percentages are based on net assets.
(2)
Assets are pledged as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 6 “Debt”.
(3)
For Industry subtotal and percentage, see Note 4 "Investments."
(4)
Represents the actual interest rate for partially or fully funded debt in effect as of the reporting date. Certain investments are subject to an interest rate floor. 
Variable rate loans bear interest at a rate that may be determined by the larger of the floor or the reference to either Euribor ("E"), SOFR, including SOFR 
adjustment, if any, (“S”), SONIA (“SN”), NIBOR (“N”), CORRA (“C”), BBSW (“B”) or alternate base rate (commonly based on the U.S. Prime Rate (“P”), 
unless otherwise noted) at the borrower's option, which reset periodically based on the terms of the credit agreement. S loans are typically indexed to 12 
month, 6 month, 3 month or 1 month S rates. As of June 30, 2025, 3 month E was 1.94%, 6 month E was 2.05%, 1 month S was 4.32%, 3 month S was 
4.29%, 6 month S was 4.15%, 3 month SN was 4.22%, 3 month C was 2.68%, 3 month N was 4.25%, 1 month B was 3.61% and P was 7.50%. For 
investments with multiple reference rates or alternate base rates, the interest rate shown is the weighted average interest rate in effect at June 30, 2025.
(5)
Par amount is presented for debt investments, while the number of shares or units owned is presented for equity investments. Par amount is denominated in 
U.S. Dollars (“$” or “USD”) unless otherwise noted, Euros (“EUR”), Great British Pounds (“GBP”), Norwegian Kroner (“NOK”), Canadian Dollars 
(“CAD”) or Australian Dollars (“AUD”).
(6)
Represents co-investments made with the Company’s affiliates in accordance with the terms of the exemptive relief received from the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
(7)
The fair value of the investment was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 5 “Fair Value Measurement”.
(8)
The investment is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act (as defined below). The Company may not acquire any non-
qualifying asset unless, at the time of acquisition, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company’s total assets. As of June 30, 2025, the aggregate 
fair value of these securities is $269,827 or 7.9% of the Company’s total assets.
(9)
Position or portion thereof is an unfunded loan commitment, and no interest is being earned on the unfunded portion. The unfunded loan commitment may 
be subject to a commitment termination date that may expire prior to the maturity date stated. The negative cost, if applicable, is the result of the capitalized 
discount being greater than the principal amount outstanding on the loan. The negative fair value, if applicable, is the result of the capitalized discount on the 
loan. See Note 8 “Commitments and Contingencies”.
(10)
As defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), the investment is deemed to be an “affiliated person” of 
the Company because the Company owns, either directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the portfolio company’s outstanding voting securities. See Note 3 
“Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”.
(11)
The investment is on non-accrual status. See Note 2 “Significant Accounting Policies”.
(12)
The investment includes an exit fee that is receivable upon repayment of the loan. See Note 2 “Significant Accounting Policies."
(13)
In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the “last-out” portion of the Company's unitranche loan investment generally earns a higher interest rate than the 
“first-out” portions. The “first-out” portion would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due 
thereunder over the “last-out” portion.
(14)
Non-income producing security.
(15)
The Company sold a participating interest of the portfolio company’s second lien senior secured loan and unsecured debt. As the transaction did not qualify 
for sale accounting in accordance with GAAP (as defined below), the Company recorded a corresponding $3,060 secured borrowing at fair value, which is 
included in “secured borrowings” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of June 30, 2025, the interest rate in effect for 
the secured borrowing was 16.57% and S + 15% PIK for the second lien senior secured loan and unsecured debt, respectively. See Note 2 “Significant 
Accounting Policies".
(16)
Securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and may be deemed to be “restricted securities”. As 
of June 30, 2025, the aggregate fair value of these securities is $66,306 or 4.4% of the Company's net assets. The initial acquisition dates have been included 
for such securities.
(17)
Share amount rounds to less than 1.
(18)
The investment is otherwise deemed to be an “affiliated person” of the Company. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”.
(19)
The annualized seven-day yield as of June 30, 2025 is 4.21%.

(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
(1)
Percentages are based on net assets.
(2)
For Industry subtotal and percentage, see Note 4 "Investments."
(3)
Represents the actual interest rate for partially or fully funded debt in effect as of the reporting date. Certain investments are subject to an interest rate floor. 
Variable rate loans bear interest at a rate that may be determined by the larger of the floor or the reference to either Euribor (“E”), SOFR including SOFR 
adjustment, if any, (“S”), SONIA (“SN”), NIBOR (“N”), CORRA (“C”), BBSW (“B”) or alternate base rate (commonly based on the U.S. Prime Rate (“P”), 
unless otherwise noted) at the borrower's option, which reset periodically based on the terms of the credit agreement. S loans are typically indexed to 12 
month, 6 month, 3 month or 1 month S rates. As of December 31, 2024, 3 month E was 2.71%, 1 month S was 4.33%, 3 month S was 4.31%, 6 month S was 
4.25%, 3 month SN was 4.70%, 1 month C was 3.28%, 3 month C was 3.15%, 3 month N was 4.68%, 1 month B was 4.32% and P was 7.50%. For 
investments with multiple reference rates or alternate base rates, the interest rate shown is the weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2024.
(4)
Par amount is presented for debt investments, while the number of shares or units owned is presented for equity investments. Par amount is denominated in 
USD unless otherwise noted, EUR, GBP, NOK, CAD or AUD.
(5)
Assets are pledged as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 6 “Debt”.
(6)
Represents co-investments made with the Company’s affiliates in accordance with the terms of the exemptive relief received from the SEC. See Note 3 
“Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”.
(7)
The investment is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. The Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset 
unless, at the time of acquisition, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company’s total assets. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate fair value 
of these securities is $213,354 or 5.9% of the Company’s total assets.
(8)
The fair value of the investment was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 5 “Fair Value Measurement”.
(9)
Position or portion thereof is an unfunded loan commitment, and no interest is being earned on the unfunded portion. The unfunded loan commitment may 
be subject to a commitment termination date that may expire prior to the maturity date stated. The negative cost, if applicable, is the result of the capitalized 
discount being greater than the principal amount outstanding on the loan. The negative fair value, if applicable, is the result of the capitalized discount on the 
loan. See Note 8 "Commitments and Contingencies".
(10)
As defined in the Investment Company Act, the investment is deemed to be an “affiliated person” of the Company because the Company owns, either 
directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the portfolio company’s outstanding voting securities. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party 
Transactions”.
(11)
Non-income producing security.
(12)
The Company is in discussions with the investment to extend the maturity date through an amendment.

The investment is on non-accrual status. See Note 2 "Significant Accounting Policies".
(14)
The investment includes an exit fee that is receivable upon repayment of the loan. See Note 2 “Significant Accounting Policies".
(15)
In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the “last-out” portion of the Company's unitranche loan investment generally earns a higher interest rate than the 
“first-out” portions. The “first-out” portion would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due 
thereunder over the “last-out” portion.
(16)
The Company sold a participating interest of the portfolio company’s second lien senior secured loan and unsecured debt. As the transaction did not qualify 
for sale accounting in accordance with GAAP (as defined below), the Company recorded a corresponding $2,920 secured borrowing at fair value, which is 
included in “secured borrowings” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate in 
effect for the secured borrowing was 16.75% and S + 15% PIK for the second lien senior secured loan and unsecured debt, respectively. See Note 2 
"Significant Accounting Policies".

Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
(Unaudited)
 
1.
ORGANIZATION 
Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. (the “Company,” which term refers to either Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. or Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc., together 
with its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context may require) was initially established as Goldman Sachs Liberty Harbor Capital, LLC, a 
single member Delaware limited liability company (“SMLLC”), on September 26, 2012 and commenced operations on November 15, 
2012 with The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“GS Group Inc.”) as its sole member. On March 29, 2013, the Company elected to be 
regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act. Effective April 1, 2013, the Company 
converted from a SMLLC to a Delaware corporation. In addition, the Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment 
company (“RIC”), and the Company expects to qualify annually for tax treatment as a RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. 
The Company’s investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct 
originations of secured debt, including first lien debt, unitranche debt, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and 
unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments. 
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”), a Delaware limited partnership and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC 
(including its predecessors, “GS & Co.”), is the investment adviser (the “Investment Adviser”) of the Company. The term “Goldman 
Sachs” refers to GS Group Inc., together with GS & Co., GSAM and its other subsidiaries. 
On March 23, 2015, the Company completed its initial public offering and the Company’s common stock began trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange under the symbol “GSBD.” 
The Company has formed wholly-owned subsidiaries, which are structured as Delaware limited liability companies, to hold certain equity 
or equity-like investments in portfolio companies.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Presentation 
The Company’s functional currency is USD and these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in that currency. The 
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to Regulation S-X. This requires the Company to make certain estimates and 
assumptions that may affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These consolidated 
financial statements reflect normal and recurring adjustments that in the opinion of the Company are necessary for the fair statement of the 
results for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions included in the consolidated financial 
statements. 
Certain financial information that is included in annual consolidated financial statements, including certain financial statement disclosures, 
prepared in accordance with GAAP, is not required for interim reporting purposes and has been condensed or omitted herein. These 
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes 
related thereto for the year ended December 31, 2024, included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the 
SEC on February 27, 2025. The results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be 
expected for the full fiscal year, any other interim period or any future year or period.
As an investment company, the Company applies the accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 
Topic 946, Financial Services – Investment Companies (“ASC 946”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). 
Basis of Consolidation 
As provided under ASC 946, the Company will not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary 
or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Accordingly, the Company 
consolidated the financial position and results of operations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, BDC Blocker I, LLC, GSBD Blocker II, 
LLC, GSBD Wine I, LLC, GSBD Blocker III, LLC, GSBD Blocker IV, LLC, GSBD Blocker V, LLC, MMLC Blocker I, LLC, MMLC

Revenue Recognition 
The Company records its investment transactions on a trade date basis, which is the date when the Company assumes the risks for gains 
and losses related to that instrument. Realized gains and losses are based on the specific identification method. 
Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums 
to par value on investments purchased are accreted and amortized into interest income over the life of the respective investment using the 
effective interest method. Loan origination fees, original issue discount (“OID”) and market discounts or premiums are capitalized and 
amortized into interest income using the effective interest method or straight-line method, as applicable. Exit fees that are receivable upon 
repayment of a loan or debt security are amortized into interest income over the life of the respective investment. Upon prepayment of a 
loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as 
interest income, for which the Company has earned the following:

Fees received from portfolio companies (directors’ fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar 
compensation) are paid to the Company, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, the 
Company only receives its allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as another Account (as defined 
below) managed by the Investment Adviser. 
Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the 
portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for 
private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are 
presented net of withholding tax, if any. 
Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated 
dividends that are added to the principal amount or shares (if equity) of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment 
dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon the investment being called by the issuer. PIK is 
recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the 
investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, 
uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income. 
Certain structuring fees, amendment fees, syndication fees and commitment fees are recorded as other income when earned. 
Administrative agent fees received by the Company are recorded as other income when the services are rendered over time. 
Acquisition Accounting
On October 12, 2020, the Company completed its merger (the “Merger”) with Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp. (“GS 
MMLC”) pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 11, 2020. The Merger was accounted 
for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations—Related Issues. The consideration paid to GS 
MMLC’s stockholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase 
discount (the “Purchase Discount”). The Purchase Discount was allocated to the cost of GS MMLC investments acquired by the Company 
on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the closing date. Immediately following the Merger with GS MMLC, the 
investments were marked to their respective fair values and, as a result, the Purchase Discount allocated to the cost basis of the 
investments acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized appreciation on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Purchase 
Discount allocated to the loan investments acquired is amortized over the life of each respective loan through interest income with a 
corresponding adjustment recorded as unrealized depreciation on such loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. Amortization 
income of the Purchase Discount for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was $1,001 and $1,806. Amortization income of the 
Purchase Discount for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was $1,741 and $3,064. The Purchase Discount allocated to equity 
investments acquired is not amortized over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to 
the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company will recognize a 
realized gain with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.

Table of Contents
Non-Accrual Investments 
Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to 
contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or 
dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon 
management’s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid 
and, in management’s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. The Company may make 
exceptions to this treatment if an investment has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of June 30, 2025, the 
Company had certain investments held in seven portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 2.5% and 1.6% of the total 
investments (excluding investments in money market funds, if any) at amortized cost and at fair value. As of December 31, 2024, the 
Company had certain investments held in nine portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 4.5% and 2.0% of the total 
investments (excluding investments in money market funds, if any) at amortized cost and at fair value. 
Investments 
The Company carries its investments in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), issued 
by the FASB, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value 
measurements. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices provided by independent price sources. In the absence of quoted 
market prices, investments are measured at fair value as determined by the Investment Adviser, as the valuation designee (the “Valuation 
Designee”) designated by the board of directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”), pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under 
the Investment Company Act. 
Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been 
realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. See Note 5 “Fair Value Measurement.” 
The Company generally invests in illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments, of middle-market companies. The Board of 
Directors has designated to the Investment Adviser day-to-day responsibilities for implementing and maintaining internal controls and 
procedures related to the valuation of the Company’s portfolio investments. Under valuation procedures approved by the Board of 
Directors and adopted by the Valuation Designee, market quotations are generally used to assess the value of the investments for which 
market quotations are readily available (as defined in Rule 2a-5). The Investment Adviser obtains these market quotations from 
independent pricing sources. If market quotations are not readily available, the Investment Adviser prices securities at the bid prices 
obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available; otherwise, the Investment Adviser obtains prices from a principal market maker 
or a primary market dealer. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Investment Adviser 
regularly performs price verification procedures and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing sources or brokers, and any 
differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. If the Valuation Designee believes any such market quotation does 
not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investment in accordance with valuation procedures for 
investments for which market quotations are not readily available. 
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not 
reflective of the fair value, the valuation procedures approved by the Board of Directors and adopted by the Valuation Designee, 
contemplate a multi-step valuation process conducted by the Investment Adviser each quarter and more frequently as needed. As the 
Valuation Designee, the Investment Adviser is primarily responsible for the valuation of the Company’s assets, subject to the oversight of 
the Board of Directors, as described below: 
(1)
The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment 
professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the valuation of the portfolio investment; 
(2)
The Valuation Designee also engages independent valuation firms (the “Independent Valuation Advisors”) to provide 
independent valuations of the investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but 
deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment. The Independent Valuation Advisors independently value such 
investments using quantitative and qualitative information. The Independent Valuation Advisors also provide analyses to 
support their valuation methodology and calculations. The Independent Valuation Advisors provide an opinion on a final 
range of values on such investments to the Valuation Designee. The Independent Valuation Advisors define fair value in 
accordance with ASC 820 and utilize valuation approaches including the market approach, the income approach or both. A 
portion of the portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, and all investments in the portfolio for which market quotations are 
not readily available, or are readily available, but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment, are reviewed at 
least annually by an Independent Valuation Advisor; 

43
 
 

Table of Contents
44
 
 
(3)
The Independent Valuation Advisors’ preliminary valuations are reviewed by the Investment Adviser and the Valuation 
Oversight Group (the “VOG”), a team that is part of the controllers group of Goldman Sachs. The Independent Valuation 
Advisors’ valuation ranges are compared to the Investment Adviser’s valuations to ensure the Investment Adviser’s 
valuations are reasonable. The VOG presents the valuations to the Asset Management Private Investment Valuation and Side 
Pocket Working Group of the Asset Management Valuation Committee (the “Asset Management Private Investment 
Valuation and Side Pocket Working Group”), which is comprised of a number of representatives from different functions and 
areas of expertise related to GSAM’s business and controls who are independent of the investment decision making process; 
(4)
The Asset Management Private Investment Valuation and Side Pocket Working Group reviews and preliminarily approves 
the fair valuations and makes fair valuation recommendations to the Asset Management Valuation Committee; 
(5)
The Asset Management Valuation Committee reviews the valuation information provided by the Asset Management Private 
Investment Valuation and Side Pocket Working Group, the VOG, the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser 
responsible for valuations, and the Independent Valuation Advisors. The Asset Management Valuation Committee then 
assesses such valuation recommendations; and 
(6)
Through the Asset Management Valuation Committee, the Valuation Designee discusses the valuations, provides written 
reports to the Board of Directors on at least a quarterly basis, and, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, 
determines the fair value of the investments in good faith, based on the inputs of the Asset Management Valuation 
Committee, the Asset Management Private Investment Valuation and Side Pocket Working Group, the VOG, the investment 
professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for valuations, and the Independent Valuation Advisors. 
Money Market Funds 
Investments in money market funds are valued at NAV per share and are considered cash equivalents for the purposes of the management 
fee paid to the Investment Adviser. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions.” 
Cash 
Cash consists of deposits held at State Street Bank and Trust Company (the “Custodian”). As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 
the Company held an aggregate cash balance of $108,036 and $61,795. Foreign currency of $4,310 and $4,969 (acquisition costs of 
$4,246 and $5,076) is included in cash as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated into USD on the following basis: (i) investments and other assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into USD based upon currency exchange rates effective on the last business day of the 
period; and (ii) purchases and sales of investments, borrowings and repayments of such borrowings, income, and expenses denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated into USD based upon currency exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. 
The Company does not isolate the portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments 
from fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included within the net realized and 
unrealized gains or losses on investments. Fluctuations arising from the translation of non-investment assets and liabilities, if any, are 
included with the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency translations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Foreign securities and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. 
companies and U.S. government securities. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future 
adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices to be 
more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities. 

Table of Contents
45
 
 
Derivatives 
The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the Company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies. In a foreign currency forward contract, the Company agrees to receive or deliver a fixed 
quantity of one currency for another, at a pre-determined price at a future date. Forward foreign currency contracts are marked-to-market 
at the applicable forward rate. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency forward contracts is recorded on the 
Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities by counterparty on a net basis, not taking into account collateral posted which is 
recorded separately, if applicable. Notional amounts of foreign currency forward contract assets and liabilities are presented separately on 
the Consolidated Schedules of Investments. Purchases and settlements of foreign currency forward contracts having the same settlement 
date and counterparty are generally settled net and any realized gains or losses are recognized on the settlement date. The Company does 
not utilize hedge accounting and as such, the Company recognizes its derivatives at fair value, and records changes in the net unrealized 
appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency forward contracts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Income Taxes 
The Company recognizes tax positions in its consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be 
sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this 
standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized upon settlement. The Company reports any 
interest expense related to income tax matters in income tax expense and any income tax penalties in expenses in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations. 
The Company’s tax positions have been reviewed based on applicable statutes of limitation for tax assessments, which may vary by 
jurisdiction, and based on such review, the Company has concluded that no additional provision for income tax is required in the 
consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to potential examination by certain taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. 
The Company’s tax positions are subject to ongoing interpretation of laws and regulations by taxing authorities. 
The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. So long as the Company 
maintains its qualification for tax treatment as a RIC, it will generally not be required to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on 
any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. As a result, any U.S. federal 
income tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company represents obligations of the Company’s stockholders and 
will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 
To maintain its tax treatment as a RIC, the Company must meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and 
timely distribute to its stockholders for each taxable year at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (generally, its net 
ordinary income plus the excess of its realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without 
regard to the dividends paid deduction). In order for the Company not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually 
an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of its net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the 
calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year 
and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such 
years. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% nondeductible 
U.S. federal excise tax on this income. If the Company chooses to do so, this generally would increase expenses and reduce the amount 
available to be distributed to stockholders without reducing its required distribution. The Company will accrue excise tax on estimated 
undistributed taxable income as required. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company accrued excise taxes of $906 
and $2,213. As of June 30, 2025, $2,487 of accrued excise taxes remained payable. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the 
Company accrued excise taxes of $1,241 and $2,315.
Certain of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. Income tax expense, 
if any, is included under the income category for which it applies in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Distributions 
Distributions from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax 
regulations, which may differ from those amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company may pay distributions in excess 
of its taxable net investment income. This excess would be a tax-free return of capital in the period and reduce the stockholder’s tax basis 
in its shares. These book/tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent, they 
are charged or credited to paid-in capital in excess of par or distributable earnings, as appropriate, in the period that the differences arise. 
Temporary and permanent differences are primarily attributable to differences in the tax treatment of certain loans and the tax 
characterization of income and non-deductible expenses. These differences are generally determined in conjunction with the preparation 
of the Company’s annual RIC tax return. Distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be 
paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by the 
Investment Adviser. The Company may pay distributions to its stockholders in a year in excess of its net ordinary income and capital 
gains for that year and, accordingly, a portion of such distributions may constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
The Company intends to timely distribute to its stockholders substantially all of its annual taxable income for each year, except that the 
Company may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment and, depending upon the level of the Company’s taxable income earned in 
a year, the Company may choose to carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay any applicable tax. The 
specific tax characteristics of the Company’s distributions will be reported to stockholders after the end of the calendar year. All 
distributions will be subject to available funds, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to declare such distributions 
in future periods. 
The Company has a voluntary dividend reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) that provides for the automatic reinvestment of all cash 
distributions declared by the Board of Directors unless a stockholder elects to “opt out” of the plan. As a result, if the Board of Directors 
declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not “opted out” of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically 
reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. If the distribution is subject to withholding tax 
as described above, only the net after-tax amount will be reinvested in additional shares. Stockholders who receive distributions in the 
form of shares of common stock will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received 
cash distributions and, for this purpose, stockholders receiving distributions in the form of stock will generally be treated as receiving 
distributions equal to the amount of cash that the stockholders would have received if they had elected to receive the distributions in cash 
(or the fair market value of the shares received through the plan, if the Company issues additional shares with a fair market value equal to 
or greater than net asset value); however, since the cash distributions of participants in the plan will be reinvested, those stockholders will 
not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. Due to regulatory considerations, GS Group Inc. and GS & Co. have opted out of 
the DRIP.
Deferred Financing and Debt Issuance Costs 
Deferred financing and debt issuance costs consist of fees and expenses paid in connection with the closing of and amendments to the 
Company’s borrowings. The aforementioned costs are amortized using the straight-line method over each instrument’s term. Deferred 
financing costs related to a revolving credit facility are presented separately as an asset on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of 
Assets and Liabilities. Deferred debt issuance costs related to any notes are presented net against the outstanding debt balance on the 
Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. 
Offering Costs
Offering costs consist of fees and expenses incurred in connection with equity offerings. Offering costs are charged against the proceeds 
from equity offerings when proceeds are received.
Secured Borrowings 
The Company may enter into sales agreements to participate all or a portion of its investments to third parties. Under Topic 860, Transfers 
and Servicing (“ASC 860”), certain loan sales do not qualify for sale accounting because these sales do not meet the definition of a 
“participating interest” as defined in the guidance, in order for sale treatment to be allowed. Sales that do not meet the definition of a 
participating interest or are not eligible for sales accounting remain as an investment on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and 
Liabilities as required under GAAP and the proceeds are recorded as secured borrowing. Secured borrowings are carried at fair value and 
have been categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

Segment Reporting
In accordance with ASC 280 – Segment reporting, the Company has determined that it operates through a single operating and reporting 
segment with the investment objectives to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation through direct origination of 
secured debt, unsecured debt and select equity investments. The chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) is comprised of the 
Company’s chief executive officers, chief financial officer and chief operating officer. The CODM uses Net increase (decrease) in net 
assets from operations in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations to assess the Company’s performance and allocate 
resources. The evaluation and assessment of this metric is used in implementing investment policy decisions, managing the Company’s 
portfolio, evaluation of the Company’s distribution policy and assessing the performance of the portfolio. As the Company’s operations 
comprise of a single reporting segment, the segment assets are reflected on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and 
Liabilities as "Total assets" and the significant segment expenses are listed on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
New Accounting Pronouncements 
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” This ASU requires additional 
disaggregation of certain expenses within the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. This ASU is effective for the annual 
periods beginning in January 2027, and interim periods beginning in January 2028 under a prospective approach. Early adoption and 
retrospective application are permitted. Since this ASU only requires additional disclosures, adoption of this ASU will not have an impact 
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Investment Management Agreement 
The Company entered into an investment management agreement (the “Investment Management Agreement”) with the Investment 
Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser manages the Company’s investment program and related activities. 
Management Fee 
The Company pays the Investment Adviser a management fee (the “Management Fee”), accrued and payable quarterly in arrears. The 
Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% (0.25% per quarter) of the average of the values of the Company’s gross assets 
(excluding cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the two most recently 
completed calendar quarters. The Management Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated. The Investment Adviser waives a 
portion of its management fee payable by the Company in an amount equal to the management fees it earns as an investment adviser for 
any affiliated money market funds in which the Company invests.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, Management Fees amounted to $8,408 and $17,089. As of June 30, 2025, $8,408 
remained payable. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, Management Fees amounted to $8,865 and $17,597.
Incentive Fee 
The incentive fee (the “Incentive Fee”) consists of two components that are determined independent of each other, with the result that one 
component may be payable even if the other is not. The Incentive Fee is calculated as follows: 
A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on income and a portion is based on capital gains, each as described below. The Investment 
Adviser is entitled to receive the Incentive Fee based on income if Ordinary Income (as defined below) exceeds a quarterly “hurdle rate” 
of 1.75%. For this purpose, the hurdle is computed by reference to the Company’s NAV and does not take into account changes in the 
market price of the Company’s common stock. 
The Incentive Fee based on income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to the 
Company’s aggregate net investment income, as adjusted as described below, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven 
preceding calendar quarters (such period, the “Trailing Twelve Quarters”). The Incentive Fee based on capital gains is determined and 
paid annually in arrears at the end of each calendar year by reference to an “Annual Period,” which means the period beginning on 
January 1 of each calendar year and ending on December 31 of such calendar year or, in the case of the first and last year, the appropriate 
portion thereof. 
The hurdle amount for the Incentive Fee based on income is determined on a quarterly basis and is equal to 1.75% multiplied by the 
Company’s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle 
amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments for subscriptions (which includes all of the Company’s issuances of shares of 
its common stock, including issuances pursuant to its DRIP) and distributions that occurred during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. 

47
 
 
The Incentive Fee for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. 
i. Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Income 
For the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income, the Company pays the Investment Adviser a quarterly Incentive Fee based on the 
amount by which (A) aggregate net investment income (“Ordinary Income”) in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds 
(B) the hurdle 

Table of Contents
amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve 
Quarters is referred to as the “Excess Income Amount.” Ordinary Income is net of all fees and expenses, including the Management Fee 
but excluding any Incentive Fee. 
The Incentive Fee based on income for each quarter is determined as follows: 
•
No Incentive Fee based on income is payable to the Investment Adviser for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess 
Income Amount; 
•
100% of the Ordinary Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle amount, but is less than or equal to an amount, referred to as the 
“Catch-up Amount,” determined as the sum of 2.1875% for the periods through December 31, 2024 and 2.12% for the 
periods after December 31, 2024, multiplied by the Company’s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter 
comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income; and 
•
20% of the Ordinary Income for the periods through December 31, 2024 and 17.5% of Ordinary Income for the periods after 
December 31, 2024 that exceeds the Catch-up Amount is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income. 
The amount of the Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter equals the excess of the 
Incentive Fee so calculated minus the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar 
quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters but not in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap (as described 
below). 
The Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the “Incentive Fee 
Cap”). The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) the sum of 20% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) 
during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters through December 31, 2024 and 17.5% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) 
during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters after December 31, 2024, minus (b) the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were 
paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. 
“Cumulative Net Return” means (x) the Ordinary Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital 
Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the 
Company pays no Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for 
such quarter is a positive value but is less than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such 
quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company pays an Incentive Fee based on income 
to the Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is 
equal to or greater than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect 
to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company pays an Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser 
equal to the Incentive Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. 
“Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized 
or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period. 
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, Incentive Fees based on income amounted to $8,526 and $15,330. As of June 30, 2025, 
$8,526 remained payable. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, Incentive Fees based on income amounted to $0 and 
$10,882. 
ii. Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains 
The portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is calculated on an annual basis. For each Annual Period, the Company pays the 
Investment Adviser an amount equal to (A) 20% for the periods through December 31, 2024 and 17.5% for the periods after December 31, 
2024 of the difference, if positive, of the sum of the Company’s aggregate realized capital gains, if any, computed net of the Company’s 
aggregate realized capital losses, if any, and the Company’s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, in each case from April 1, 2013 
until the end of such Annual Period minus (B) the cumulative amount of Incentive Fees based on capital gains previously paid to the 
Investment Adviser from April 1, 2013. For the avoidance of doubt, unrealized capital appreciation is excluded from the calculation in 
clause (A) above. 
The Company accrues, but does not pay, a portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains with respect to net unrealized appreciation. 
Under GAAP, the Company is required to accrue an Incentive Fee based on capital gains that includes net realized capital gains and losses 
and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the accrual for the 
Incentive Fee based on capital gains, the Company considers the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, 
since an Incentive Fee based on capital gains would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such 

48
 
 
unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee payable under the Investment Management 
Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative net realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative net 
unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company records a capital 
gains incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount, minus the aggregate amount of actual Incentive Fees based on capital gains paid in all 
prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital 
appreciation will be realized in the future.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company did not accrue or pay any Incentive Fees based on capital gains.
Administration and Custodian Fees 
The Company has entered into an administration agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (the “Administrator”) under which 
the Administrator provides various accounting and administrative services to the Company. The Company pays the Administrator fees for 
its services as it determines to be commercially reasonable in its sole discretion. The Company also reimburses the Administrator for all 
reasonable expenses. To the extent that the Administrator outsources any of its functions, the Administrator pays any compensation 
associated with such functions. The Administrator also serves as the Company’s Custodian. Administration and Custodian fees are 
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as Other general and administrative expenses.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company incurred expenses for services provided by the Administrator and the 
Custodian of $522 and $1,047. As of June 30, 2025, $524 remained payable. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the 
Company incurred expenses for services provided by the Administrator and the Custodian of $526 and $1,038.
Transfer Agent Fees 
The Company has entered into a transfer agency and services agreement pursuant to which Computershare Trust Company, N.A. serves as 
the Company’s transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”), dividend agent and registrar. Transfer Agent fees are included in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations as Other general and administrative expenses.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company incurred expenses for services provided by the Transfer Agent of $7 and 
$14. As of June 30, 2025, $8 remained payable. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company incurred expenses for 
services provided by the Transfer Agent of $7 and $14.

Due to Affiliates 
The Investment Adviser pays certain general and administrative expenses on behalf of the Company in the ordinary course of business. As 
of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, there were $2,607 and $1,088 included within Accrued expenses and other liabilities that were 
paid by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates on behalf of the Company. 
Co-investment Activity 
In certain circumstances, the Company and certain other client accounts managed by the Investment Adviser (collectively with the 
Company, the “Accounts”, which may include proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs) can make negotiated co-investments pursuant to 
an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to do so. On May 21, 2025, the SEC granted the exemptive relief (the “Relief”) to the 
Investment Adviser, the BDCs advised by the Investment Adviser and certain other affiliated applicants, which superseded the prior co-
investment exemptive relief received on November 16, 2022, as amended on June 25, 2024 (the “Prior Relief”). If the Investment Adviser 
forms other funds in the future, the Company may co-invest alongside such other affiliates, subject to compliance with the Relief, 
applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. Any such co-investments are subject to the 
applicable conditions of the Relief. Under the Relief, expenses of a single Account will be covered by that Account alone if those 
expenses were incurred solely by that Account due to its unique circumstances, such as legal and compliance expenses. Under the terms of 
the Relief, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act) of the Company’s independent directors 
must make certain conclusions in connection with certain co-investment transactions, including co-investment transactions in which an 
affiliate of the Company is an existing investor in the portfolio company, non-pro rata incremental investments and non-pro rata 
dispositions of investments, and the Board is required to maintain oversight of the Company’s participation in the co-investment program.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., the exit price).
The fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the 
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest 
priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The levels used for classifying investments are not necessarily an indication of 
the risk associated with investing in these securities. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
Basis of Fair Value Measurement 
Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting 
date. The types of financial instruments included in Level 1 include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in 
active markets. 
Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly 
observable as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments in this category include less liquid and restricted securities listed in 
active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities and certain over-the-counter derivatives 
where the fair value is based on observable inputs. 
Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the 
determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this 
category include investments in privately held entities and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on 
unobservable inputs. 
A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement. Note 2 “Significant Accounting Policies” should be read in conjunction with the information outlined below. 
The table below presents the valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs generally used in determining the fair value of Level 
2 and Level 3 Instruments.

Table of Contents
Level 2 Instruments
 
Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs
Equity and Fixed 
Income
 The types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on 
quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price 
transparency include commercial paper, most government agency obligations, most corporate debt securities, 
certain mortgage-backed securities, certain bank loans, less liquid publicly listed equities, certain state and 
municipal obligations, certain money market instruments and certain loan commitments.
 
Valuations of Level 2 Equity and Fixed Income instruments can be verified to quoted prices, broker or dealer 
quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given 
to the nature of the quotations (e.g. indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent market activity to the 
prices provided from alternative pricing sources.
 
 
Derivative Contracts
 Over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives (both centrally cleared and bilateral) are valued using market 
transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, 
calibration to market-clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations, or other alternative pricing sources 
with reasonable levels of price transparency. Where models are used, the selection of a particular model to 
value an OTC derivative depends upon the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in, the instrument, 
as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. The Company generally uses similar models to 
value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market 
prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, voluntary and involuntary prepayment rates, loss 
severity rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model inputs 
can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. OTC 
derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when significant inputs are corroborated by 
market evidence.
 
Level 3 Instruments
 
Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs
Bank Loans, Corporate 
Debt, and Other Debt
Obligations
 Valuations are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques, for which the significant inputs are the 
amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market yields and recovery assumptions. The significant 
inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to credit 
default swaps that reference the same underlying credit risk and to other debt instruments for the same issuer 
for which observable prices or broker quotes are available. Other valuation methodologies are used as 
appropriate including market comparables, transactions in similar instruments and recovery/liquidation 
analysis.
 
 
 
Equity
 Recent third-party investments or pending transactions are considered to be the best evidence for any change 
in fair value. When these are not available, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate and 
available (i) Transactions in similar instruments; (ii) Discounted cash flow techniques; (iii) Third party 
appraisals; and (iv) Industry multiples and public comparables.
Evidence includes recent or pending reorganizations (for example, merger proposals, tender offers and debt 
restructurings) and significant changes in financial metrics, including (i) Current financial performance as 
compared to projected performance; (ii) Capitalization rates and multiples; and (iii) Market yields implied by 
transactions of similar or related assets.
 
The tables below present the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the Company’s Level 3 assets as of June 30, 2025 and 
December 31, 2024. These ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of instrument, 
but they do not represent a range of values for any one instrument. For example, the lowest discount rate in 1st Lien/Senior Secured Debt 
is appropriate for valuing that specific debt investment, but may not be appropriate for valuing any other debt investments in this asset 
class. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs presented below do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of 
the Company’s Level 3 assets.

As of June 30, 2025, included within the fair value of Level 3 assets of $3,244,938 is an amount of $189,943 for which the Investment Adviser did not 
develop the unobservable inputs (examples include single source broker quotations, third party pricing, and prior transactions). The income approach was 
used in the determination of fair value for $2,899,095 or 91.5% of Level 3 bank loans, corporate debt, and other debt obligations.
As of December 31, 2024, included within the fair value of Level 3 assets of $3,431,997 is an amount of $242,458 for which the Investment Adviser did not 
develop the unobservable inputs (examples include single source broker quotations, third party pricing, and prior transactions). The income approach was 
used in the determination of fair value for $3,028,320 or 90.0% of Level 3 bank loans, corporate debt, and other debt obligations. 
The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, market comparable and discounted cash flows 
may be used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the Level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques. 
The range for an asset category consisting of a single investment, if any, is not meaningful and therefore has been excluded. 
Weighted average for an asset category consisting of multiple investments is calculated by weighting the significant unobservable input by the relative fair 
value of the investment. Weighted average for an asset category consisting of a single investment represents the significant unobservable input used in the 
fair value of the investment. 
Enterprise value of portfolio company as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”).

As noted above, the income and market approaches were used in the determination of fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of June 30, 
2025 and December 31, 2024. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate or market yield used 
to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal 
and interest payments. An increase in the discount rate or market yield would result in a decrease in the fair value. Included in the 
consideration and selection of discount rates or market yields is risk of default, rating of the investment, call provisions and comparable 
company investments. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are based on market comparable transactions and 
market multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. Increases in market comparable transactions or market multiples would result 
in an increase in the fair value. 
The following is a summary of the Company’s assets categorized within the fair value hierarchy:

Revolving Credit Facility 
On September 19, 2013, the Company entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the “Revolving Credit 
Facility”) with various lenders. Truist Bank serves as administrative agent and Bank of America, N.A. serves as syndication agent under 
the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company has amended and restated the Revolving Credit Facility on numerous occasions between 
October 3, 2014 and June 24, 2025. 
The aggregate committed borrowing amount under the Revolving Credit Facility is $1,695,000. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an 
uncommitted accordion feature that allows the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the borrowing capacity of the 
Revolving Credit Facility to up to $2,542,500. 
Borrowings denominated in USD, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest (at the Company’s election) of 
either (i) Term SOFR plus a margin of either (x) 2.00%, (y) 1.875% (subject to maintenance of certain long-term corporate debt ratings) or 
(z) 1.75% (subject to certain gross borrowing base conditions), in each case, plus an additional 0.10% credit adjustment spread or (ii) an 
alternative base rate, which is the highest of (a) zero, (b) the highest of (i) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (ii) the Federal Funds 
Effective Rate for such day plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (iii) the rate per annum equal to (x) the greater of (A) Term SOFR for an interest period 
of one (1) month and (B) zero plus (y) 1.00%, plus a margin of either (x) 1.00%, (y) 0.875% (subject to maintenance of certain long-term 
corporate debt ratings) or (z) 0.75% (subject to certain gross borrowing base conditions). Borrowings denominated in non-USD bear 
interest of the applicable term benchmark rate or the applicable risk-free rate (the “RFR rate”) plus a margin of either 2.00%, 1.875% or 
1.75% (subject to the conditions applicable to borrowings denominated in USD that bear interest based on the applicable term benchmark 
rate or the applicable RFR rate), plus, (i) in the case of borrowings denominated in GBP only, an additional 0.1193% credit adjustment 
spread, (ii) in the case of borrowings denominated in CHF only, an additional 0.0031% and (iii) in the case of borrowings denominated in 
CAD only, an additional 0.29547% (one-month interest period) or an additional 0.32138% (three-month interest period) credit adjustment 
spread. Borrowings from certain lenders, which hold approximately 84% of total lending commitments (the "Extending Lenders"), bear 
interest at the applicable rates described above less 0.10%. With respect to borrowings denominated in USD, the Company may elect 
either Term SOFR, or an alternative base rate at the time of borrowing, and such borrowings may be converted from one benchmark to 
another at any time, subject to certain conditions. Interest is payable in arrears on the applicable interest payment date as specified therein. 
The Company pays a fee of 0.375% per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly 
in arrears. Any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility with respect to the Extending Lenders, will mature, and all accrued 
and unpaid interest will be due and payable, on June 24, 2030. Any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, will mature, 
and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable, with respect to certain remaining lenders, on May 5, 2027, and with respect to 
other remaining lenders, on October 18, 2028. 
The Revolving Credit Facility may be guaranteed by certain of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries, including any that are formed or 
acquired by the Company in the future. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of 
portfolio investments. 
The Company’s obligations to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in 
substantially all of the Company’s portfolio of investments and cash, with certain exceptions. The Revolving Credit Facility contains 
certain covenants, including: (i) maintaining a minimum stockholder’s equity of $800,000 plus 25% of net proceeds of the sale of equity 
interests of the Company after February 25, 2020, (ii) maintaining a minimum asset coverage ratio of at least 150%, (iii) maintaining a 
minimum asset coverage ratio of 200% with respect to the consolidated assets (with certain limitations on the contribution of equity in 
financing subsidiaries as specified therein) of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors to the secured debt of the Company and its 
subsidiary guarantors, and (iv) complying with restrictions on industry concentrations in the Company’s investment portfolio. As of June 
30, 2025, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. 
Costs of $38,024 were incurred in connection with obtaining and amending the Revolving Credit Facility, which have been recorded as 
deferred financing costs in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and are being amortized over the life of the Revolving 
Credit Facility using the straight-line method. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the unamortized deferred financing costs were 
$14,801 and $11,897.

DERIVATIVES 
The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to help mitigate the impact that an adverse change in 
foreign exchange rates would have on the value of the Company’s investments denominated in foreign currencies. 
In order to better define its contractual rights and to secure rights that will help the Company mitigate its counterparty risk, the Company 
may enter into an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Master Agreement (“ISDA Master Agreement”) or a similar 
agreement with its derivative counterparties. An ISDA Master Agreement is a bilateral agreement between the Company and a 
counterparty that governs OTC derivatives, including foreign currency forward contracts, and typically contains, among other things, 
collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event of a default and/or termination event. The provisions of the ISDA Master 
Agreement typically permit a single net payment in the event of a default (close-out netting) or similar event, including the bankruptcy or 
insolvency of the counterparty. 
For financial reporting purposes, cash collateral that has been pledged to cover obligations of the Company and cash collateral received 
from the counterparty, if any, is included on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as other assets or other liabilities. The 
Company minimizes counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with counterparties that it believes to be in good standing 
and by monitoring the financial stability of those counterparties. 
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company’s average USD notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts 
was $2,661 and $2,661. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company’s average USD notional exposure to foreign 
currency forward contracts was $7,749 and $7,749.
The Company’s net exposure to foreign currency forward contracts that are subject to ISDA Master Agreements or similar agreements 
presented on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, all of which are with Bank of America, N.A., was as follows:

Contingencies 
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that provide a variety of general indemnifications. Any exposure to 
the Company under these arrangements could involve future claims that may be made against the Company. Currently, no such claims 
exist or are expected to arise and, accordingly, the Company has not accrued any liability in connection with such indemnifications. 
9. NET ASSETS 
At-the-market (“ATM”) Offering
The Company may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of its common stock through public or ATM offerings. 
On November 15, 2023, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement (the “2023 Equity Distribution Agreement”) by and 
among the Company, GSAM and Truist Securities Inc. (“Truist”). On and effective June 5, 2025, the Company terminated the 2023 
Equity Distribution Agreement in accordance with its terms. 
The 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement provided that the Company could, from time to time, issue and sell shares of its common stock, 
par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $200,000, through Truist, or to Truist as principal for its own 
account. Sales of the shares, if any, were made in negotiated transactions or transactions that were deemed to be an ATM offering as 
defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act including sales made directly on or through the New York Stock Exchange or a similar 
securities exchange, sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, at market prices related to prevailing market 
prices or negotiated prices, sales made through any other existing trading market or electronic communications network, or by any other 
method permitted by law, including but not limited to privately negotiated transactions, which may have included block trades, as the 
Company and Truist agreed. Truist received a commission from the Company of up to 1.00% of the gross sales price of any shares sold 
through or to Truist under the 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement. 
In connection with the issuance of its common stock, the Company issued and sold the following shares of common stock through ATM 
offerings:

Distributions 
The Company has adopted a DRIP that provides for the automatic reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by the Board of Directors 
unless a stockholder elects to “opt out” of the DRIP. As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the 
stockholders who have not “opted out” of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of 
common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. The shares distributed by the Transfer Agent in the Company’s DRIP are either 
through (i) newly issued shares or (ii) acquired by the Transfer Agent through the purchase of outstanding shares on the open market. If, 
on the payment date for any distribution, the most recently computed NAV per share as of the DRIP is equal to or less than the closing 
market price plus estimated per share fees, the Transfer Agent will invest the distribution amount in newly issued shares. Otherwise, the 
Transfer Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired by purchasing shares on the open market. The following table 
summarizes the distributions declared on shares of the Company’s common stock and shares distributed pursuant to the DRIP to 
stockholders who had not opted out of the DRIP:

Common Stock Repurchase Plan
On August 8, 2024, the Board of Directors approved and authorized a 10b5-1 stock repurchase program which allows the Company to 
repurchase up to $75,000 of shares of the Company’s common stock if the stock trades below the most recently announced quarter-end 
NAV per share, subject to certain limitations. On June 13, 2025, the Company entered into a 10b5-1 stock repurchase plan (the “2025 
10b5-1 Plan”) 

Table of Contents
65
 
 
with Georgeson Securities Corporation (“Georgeson”) for repurchases of the Company’s common stock during the period from June 16, 
2025 through June 13, 2026. Unless extended by the Board, the 2025 10b5-1 Plan will terminate 12 months from the date it was entered 
into.
Under the 2025 10b5-1 Plan, no purchases are permitted to be made if such purchases would cause the Company’s Debt/Equity Ratio to 
exceed the lower of (a) 1.20 or (b) the Maximum Debt/Equity Ratio. In the 2025 10b5-1 Plan, “Debt/Equity Ratio” means the sum of debt 
on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities less cash and investments in affiliated money market funds divided by net assets, 
as of the most recent reported financial statement end date, and “Maximum Debt/Equity Ratio” means the sum of debt on the 
Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and committed uncalled debt less cash and investments in affiliated money market funds 
divided by net assets, as of the most recent reported financial statement end date. Purchases under the 2025 10b5-1 Plan are required to be 
conducted on a programmatic basis in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act and other applicable securities 
laws. 
Any repurchase by the Company of its common stock under any 10b5-1 plan or otherwise may result in the price of the Company’s 
common stock being higher than the price that otherwise might have existed in the open market.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, repurchases under the 2025 10b5-1 Plan were as follows:

References to “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company,” mean Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. or Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc., together with its

to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. “GS & Co.” refers to Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and its predecessors. The term “Goldman Sachs” 
refers to GS Group Inc., together with GS & Co., GSAM and its other subsidiaries and affiliates. The discussion and analysis contained in 
this section refer to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The information contained in this section should be read 
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Please see “Cautionary 
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with this 
discussion and analysis. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to 
factors discussed under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” appearing elsewhere in this report. 
OVERVIEW 
We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We are a closed-end management investment 
company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
amended (the “Investment Company Act”). In addition, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) and we 
expect to qualify annually for tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 
“Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. From our formation in 2012 through June 30, 2025, we originated 
approximately $9.02 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt and equity investments prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. 
We seek to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct originations of secured debt, 
including first lien, unitranche debt, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including 
mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments.
“Unitranche” loans are first lien loans that extend deeper in a borrower’s capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide 
for a waterfall of cash flow priority between different lenders in such loan. In a number of instances, we may find another lender to 
provide the “first-out” portion of a unitranche loan while we retain the “last-out” portion of such loan, in which case, the “first-out” 
portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to the payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due 
thereunder as compared to the “last-out” portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for taking greater risk of loss, the “last-out” 
portion generally earns a higher interest rate than the “first-out” portion of the loan. We use the term “mezzanine” to refer to debt that 
ranks senior in right of payment only to a borrower’s equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower’s other 
indebtedness. We may make multiple investments in the same portfolio company. 
We may also originate “covenant-lite” loans, which are loans with fewer financial maintenance covenants than other obligations, or no 
financial maintenance covenants. Such covenant-lite loans may not include terms that allow the lender to monitor the performance of the 
borrower or to declare a default if certain criteria are breached. These flexible covenants (or the absence of covenants) could permit 
borrowers to experience a significant downturn in their results of operations without triggering any default that would permit holders of 
their debt (such as us) to accelerate indebtedness or negotiate terms and pricing. In the event of default, covenant-lite loans may recover 
less value than traditional loans as the lender may not have an opportunity to negotiate with the borrower prior to such default.
We invest primarily in U.S. middle-market companies, which we believe are underserved by traditional providers of capital such as banks 
and the public debt markets. In this report, we generally use the term “middle market companies” to refer to companies with between $5 
million and $200 million of annual earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) 
excluding certain one-time, and non-recurring items that are outside the operations of these companies. However, we may from time to 
time invest in larger or smaller companies. We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we 
hold. In addition, we may generate income from various loan origination and other fees, dividends on direct equity investments and capital 
gains on the sales of investments. Fees received from portfolio companies (directors’ fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax 
advisory fees and other similar compensation) are paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief 
therefrom, we only receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as another client account 
managed by our Investment Adviser (collectively with us, the “Accounts”). The companies in which we invest use our capital for a variety 
of purposes, including to support organic growth, fund acquisitions, make capital investments or refinance indebtedness. 
Our origination strategy focuses on leading the negotiation and structuring of the loans or securities in which we invest and holding the 
investments in our portfolio to maturity. In many cases, we are the sole investor in the loan or security in our portfolio. Where there are 
multiple investors, we generally seek to control or obtain significant influence over the rights of investors in the loan or security. We 
generally seek to make investments that have maturities of three to ten years and investment size ranges from $10 million to $75 million

KEY COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS 
Investments 
Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of 
debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general 
economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we 
make. 
As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” specified in the Investment Company Act, unless, at the time the 
acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include 
investments in “eligible portfolio companies.” Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), 
“eligible portfolio companies” include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public 
companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than $250 million. 
Revenues 
We generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, capital gains and distributions, if any, on 
equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or 
payment-in-kind (“PIK”) income. The principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes 
due at the maturity date. 
We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue in 
the form of commitment, origination, structuring, syndication, exit fees or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and 
consulting fees. Portfolio company fees (directors’ fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar 
compensation) will be paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, we receive our 
allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as other Accounts, which other Accounts could receive their 
allocable portion of such fee. We do not expect to receive material fee income as it is not our principal investment strategy. We record 
contractual prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 
Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the 
portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for 
private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are 
presented net of withholding tax, if any. 
Expenses 
Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee (the “Management Fee”) and the incentive fee (the “Incentive 
Fee”) to our Investment Adviser, legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating and overhead related 
expenses. The Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, 
closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with the investment 
management agreement (the “Investment Management Agreement”) and administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”), 
including: 
 
•
our operational expenses; 
•
fees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser or payable to third parties related to our 
investments, including, among others, professional fees (including the fees and expenses of consultants and experts) and fees 
and expenses from evaluating, monitoring, researching and performing due diligence on investments and prospective 
investments; 
•
interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; 
•
fees and expenses incurred by us in connection with membership in investment company organizations; 
•
brokers’ commissions; 
•
the expenses of and fees for registering or qualifying our shares for sale and of maintaining our registration and registering us 
as a broker or a dealer; 
•
fees and expenses associated with calculating our net asset value (“NAV”) (including the costs and expenses of any 
independent valuation firm); 
•
legal, auditing or accounting expenses; 

68
 
 
•
taxes or governmental fees; 
•
the fees and expenses of our administrator, transfer agent or sub-transfer agent; 
•
the cost of preparing stock certificates or any other expenses, including clerical expenses of issue, redemption or repurchase 
of our shares; 
•
the fees and expenses of our directors who are not affiliated with our Investment Adviser; 
•
the cost of preparing and distributing reports, proxy statements and notices to our stockholders, the SEC and other regulatory 
authorities; 
•
costs of holding stockholder meetings; 

Table of Contents
69
 
 
•
listing fees; 
•
the fees or disbursements of custodians of our assets, including expenses incurred in the performance of any obligations 
enumerated by our certificate of incorporation or bylaws insofar as they govern agreements with any such custodian; 
•
insurance premiums; and 
•
costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or dispute in 
connection with our business and the amount of any judgment or settlement paid in connection therewith, or the enforcement 
of our rights against any person and indemnification or contribution expenses payable by us to any person and other 
extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of our business. 
 
We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset 
growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. Costs relating to future offerings of securities would be incremental. 
Leverage 
Our senior secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with Truist Bank, as administrative agent, 
and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, our 2.875% Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and our 6.375% Notes due 2027 (the 
“2027 Notes”) allow us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, 
with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as “leverage” and could increase or decrease returns to our stockholders. The use 
of leverage involves significant risks. We are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment 
Company Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). 
Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered borrowings or involve leverage and 
thus may be subject to Investment Company Act restrictions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and 
arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. Practices and investments that may 
involve leverage but are not considered borrowings are not subject to the Investment Company Act’s asset coverage requirement. The 
amount of leverage that we employ will depend on the assessment by our Investment Adviser and our board of directors (the "Board of 
Directors" or the “Board”) of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.

The weighted average yield at amortized cost of our portfolio excludes the Purchase Discount (as defined below) and amortization related to our merger with 
Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp. (“GS MMLC”) (the “Merger”) and does not represent the total return to our stockholders. 
Computed based on (a) the annual actual interest rate or yield earned plus amortization of fees and discounts on the performing debt and other income 
producing investments as of the reporting date, divided by (b) the total investments (including investments on non-accrual status and non-income producing 
investments) at amortized cost or fair value. 
The calculation includes incremental yield earned on the “last-out” portion of the unitranche loan investments. 
Computed based on (a) the stated coupon rate, if any, for each income-producing investment, divided by (b) the total investments (including investments on 
non-accrual status and non-income producing investments) at amortized cost or fair value. 
 
As of June 30, 2025, the total portfolio weighted average yield measured at amortized cost and fair value was 10.1% and 11.4%, as 
compared to 10.1% and 13.2% as of December 31, 2024. The decrease in the total portfolio weighted average yield at fair value and the 
decrease in weighted average yield at fair value within First Lien/Senior Secured Debt were primarily due to the restructuring of 
Streamland Media Midco LLC. Within First Lien/Last-Out Unitranche, the decrease in weighted average yield measured at amortized cost 
and fair value was driven by our 1st Lien/Last-Out Unitranche investment in Streamland Media Midco LLC being placed on non-accrual 
status. Within Second Lien/Senior Secured Debt, the decrease in weighted average yield at amortized cost was primarily driven by MPI 
Engineered Technologies, LLC being placed on non-accrual status, partially offset by the exit of Animal Supply Intermediate, LLC. The 
decrease in weighted average yield at fair value was primarily driven by MPI Engineered Technologies, LLC being placed on non-accrual 
status. Within Unsecured Debt, the decrease in weighted average yield at amortized cost and fair value was primarily driven by the exit of 
CivicPlus LLC, partially offset by Bayside Parent, LLC being restored back to accrual status.

Includes income producing preferred stock investments.
Computed based on (a) the annual actual interest rate or yield earned plus amortization of fees and discounts on the performing debt and other income 
producing investments as of the reporting date, divided by (b) the total performing debt and other income producing investments (excluding investments on 
non-accrual status). Excludes the Purchase Discount and amortization related to the Merger.
For a particular portfolio company, we calculate the level of contractual indebtedness net of cash (“net debt”) owed by the portfolio company and compare 
that amount to measures of cash flow available to service the net debt. To calculate net debt, we include debt that is both senior and pari passu to the tranche 
of debt owned by us but exclude debt that is legally and contractually subordinated in ranking to the debt owned by us. We believe this calculation method 
assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual rights of repayment of the tranche of debt owned by us 
relative to other senior and junior creditors of a portfolio company. We typically calculate cash flow available for debt service at a portfolio company by 
taking EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month period. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of our debt investments and 
excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that 
are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue.

For a particular portfolio company, we also calculate the level of contractual interest expense owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to 
EBITDA. We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual interest 
obligations of the portfolio company. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of our performing debt investments, excluding 
investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are 
underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
Median EBITDA is based on our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, 
such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. 
Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. As of June 30, 2025 and 
December 31, 2024, investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk represented 17.7% and 20.5% of total debt 
investments.
Our Investment Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company on an ongoing basis to determine if it is meeting its 
respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company. Our Investment Adviser has several 
methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include: (i) assessment of success in 
adhering to the portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants; (ii) periodic or regular contact with portfolio company 
management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; (iii) 
comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; (iv) attendance at and participation in Board meetings or 
presentations by portfolio companies; and (v) review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio 
companies. 
As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In 
addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Investment Adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 
to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to 
our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (e.g., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into 
account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and 
other relevant factors. The grading system for our investments is as follows: 
•
Grade 1 investments involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment 
since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a 
potential exit; 
•
Grade 2 investments involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time 
of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to 
ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio 
companies are initially assessed a grade of 2; 
•
Grade 3 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased 
materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance 
with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due; and 
•
Grade 4 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially 
increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt 
investments with an investment grade of 4, in most cases, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and 
payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 4, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis 
and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 
Our Investment Adviser grades the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the grade of a portfolio investment 
may be reduced or increased over time. For investments graded 3 or 4, our Investment Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the 
monitoring of such portfolio company. The following table shows the composition of our portfolio (excluding investments in money 
market funds, if any) on the 1 to 4 grading scale:

The decrease in investments with a Grade 3 investment performance rating was primarily driven by the exit of an investment with a fair 
value of $36.92 million, investments with an aggregate fair value of $28.53 million being downgraded from a Grade 3 investment 
performance rating to a Grade 4 investment performance rating due to financial underperformance and a $7.33 million decrease in the fair 
value of an investment with a Grade 3 investment performance rating as result of a restructuring. The decrease was partially offset by 
investments with an aggregate fair value of $16.89 million being downgraded from a Grade 2 investment performance rating to a Grade 3 
investment performance rating due to financial underperformance. The increase in investments with a Grade 4 investment performance 
rating was primarily driven by investments with an aggregate fair value of $28.53 million being downgraded from a Grade 3 investment 
performance rating to a Grade 4 investment performance rating as mentioned above, partially offset by a $7.31 million decrease in fair 
value of an investment with a Grade 4 investment performance rating as result of a restructuring.

Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to the 
contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or 
dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon 
management’s judgment. We may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of 
collection. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in 
management’s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current.

Net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including acquisitions, 
the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and 
depreciation in the investment portfolio.
On October 12, 2020, we completed our Merger with GS MMLC. The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance 
with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations — Related Issues. The consideration paid to GS MMLC’s stockholders was less than the 
aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “Purchase Discount”). The 
Purchase Discount was allocated to the cost of GS MMLC investments acquired by us on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair 
values as of the closing date. Immediately following the Merger with GS MMLC, we marked the investments to their respective fair 
values and, as a result, the Purchase Discount allocated to the cost basis of the investments acquired was immediately recognized as 
unrealized appreciation on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Purchase Discount allocated to the loan investments acquired 
will amortize over the life of each respective loan through interest income with a corresponding adjustment recorded as unrealized 
depreciation on such loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. The Purchase Discount allocated to equity investments acquired 
will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the 
equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, we will recognize a realized gain with a 
corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.
As a supplement to our financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of 
America (“GAAP”), we have provided, as detailed below, certain non-GAAP financial measures to our operating results that exclude the 
aforementioned Purchase Discount and the ongoing amortization thereof, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP 
financial measures include (i) Adjusted net investment income after taxes; and (ii) Adjusted net realized and unrealized gains (losses). We 
believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of the Purchase Discount is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors 
use to assess our financial condition and results of operations. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance 
investors’ understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to 
GAAP. The aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by 
other companies.

For the six months ended June 30, 2025, net realized losses were primarily driven by the restructuring of our first lien debt investments in 
Khoros, LLC (fka Lithium Technologies, Inc.) and Streamland Media Midco LLC, which resulted in a realized loss of $70.05 million and 
$20.70 million. In addition, the realized losses were also driven by the exit of Animal Supply Holdings, LLC and Animal Supply 
Intermediate, LLC, which resulted in a realized loss of $22.90 million.
For the six months ended June 30, 2024, net realized losses were primarily driven by our investments in two portfolio companies. In June 
2024, the restructuring of our first lien debt investments in Thrasio, LLC resulted in a realized loss of $26.51 million. In addition, in 
March 2024, the restructuring of our first lien debt investments in Sweep Purchaser LLC resulted in a realized loss of $17.49 million.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
We expect to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of any future offerings of securities, future borrowings and cash flows from 
operations. To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if 
the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board of Directors otherwise determines 
that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we may enter into credit facilities in 
addition to our existing credit facilities, as discussed below, or issue other senior securities. We would expect any such credit facilities 
may be secured by certain of our assets and may contain advance rates based upon pledged collateral. The pricing and other terms of any 
such facilities would depend upon market conditions when we enter into any such facilities as well as the performance of our business, 
among other factors. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage 
ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). See “—Key 
Components of Operations—Leverage.” As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, our asset coverage ratio based on the aggregate 
amount outstanding of our senior securities was 184% and 181%. We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time 
based on our financial condition and market conditions. 
The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for our investments in portfolio companies, cash 
distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes, including paying for operating expenses or debt service to the 
extent we borrow or issue senior securities. 
We historically paid a distribution to our stockholders on a quarterly basis. On February 26, 2025, we announced that we have a 
distribution framework that provides a quarterly base distribution declared in the relevant quarter and a variable supplemental distribution 
declared in the following quarter, subject to satisfaction of certain measurement tests and the approval of our Board. 
As a supplement to our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided, as detailed below, a non-GAAP financial 
measure to our financial condition that adjusts the net asset value per share for the supplemental distribution per share. We believe that 
the adjustment to the net asset value per share for the supplemental distribution is meaningful because it aligns the supplemental 
distribution to its relevant quarter earnings. Although this non-GAAP financial measure is intended to enhance investors’ understanding of 
our business and performance, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The aforementioned 
non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

We may enter into investment commitments through signed commitment letters that may ultimately become investment transactions in the 
future. We regularly evaluate and carefully consider our unfunded commitments using GSAM’s proprietary risk management framework 
for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity, including our financial leverage. 
At-the-market (“ATM”) Offering
We may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock through public or ATM offerings. On November 15, 2023, we 
entered into an equity distribution agreement (the “2023 Equity Distribution Agreement”) by and among us, GSAM and Truist Securities, 
Inc. (“Truist”). On and effective June 5, 2025, we terminated the 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement in accordance with its terms.
For further details, see Note 9 “Net Assets—At-the-market (“ATM”) Offering” to our consolidated financial statements included in this 
report.
Common Stock Repurchase Plan 
On August 8, 2024, our Board of Directors approved and authorized a 10b5-1 stock repurchase program which allows us to repurchase up 
to $75.00 million of shares of our common stock if our common stock trades below the most recently announced quarter-end NAV per 
share, subject to certain limitations. On June 13, 2025, we entered into a 10b5-1 stock repurchase plan (the “2025 10b5-1 Plan”) with 
Georgeson Securities Corporation (“Georgeson”) for repurchases of our common stock during the period from June 16, 2025 through June 
13, 2026. Unless extended by the Board, the 2025 10b5-1 Plan will terminate 12 months from the date it was entered into.
For further details, see Note 9 “Net Assets—Common Stock Repurchase Plan” to our consolidated financial statements included in this 
report.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan 

78
 
 
We have a voluntary dividend reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) that provides for automatic reinvestment of all cash distributions declared 
by our Board of Directors unless a stockholder elects to “opt out” of the plan. As a result, if our Board of Directors declares a cash 
distribution, then the stockholders who have not “opted out” of the DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in 
additional shares of

common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Due to regulatory considerations, GS Group Inc. and GS & Co. have opted out 
of the DRIP.
For further details, see Note 9 “Net Assets—Distributions” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Contractual Obligations 
We have entered into certain contracts under which we have future commitments. Payments under the Investment Management 
Agreement, pursuant to which GSAM has agreed to serve as our Investment Adviser, are equal to (1) a percentage of value of our average 
gross assets and (2) a two-part Incentive Fee. Under the Administration Agreement, pursuant to which State Street Bank and Trust 
Company has agreed to furnish us with the administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, we pay our 
administrator such fees as may be agreed between us and our administrator that we determine are commercially reasonable in our sole 
discretion. Either party or the stockholders, by a vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, may terminate the Investment 
Management Agreement without penalty on at least 60 days’ written notice to the other party. Either party may terminate the 
Administration Agreement without penalty upon at least 30 days’ written notice to the other party. The following table shows our

We may borrow amounts in USD or certain other permitted currencies. Debt outstanding denominated in currencies other than USD has been converted to 
USD using the applicable foreign currency exchange rate as of the applicable reporting date. As of June 30, 2025, we had outstanding borrowings 
denominated in U.S. Dollars ("$" or "USD") of $814.67 million, in Euros ("EUR") of EUR of 13.70 million, in Great British Pounds ("GBP") of GBP 18.95 
million, Canadian Dollars ("CAD") of CAD 52.27 million and Australian Dollars ("AUD") of AUD 12.00 million.
 
Revolving Credit Facility 
On September 19, 2013, we entered into the Revolving Credit Facility with various lenders. Truist Bank serves as administrative agent 
and Bank of America, N.A. serves as syndication agent under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
The aggregate committed borrowing amount under the Revolving Credit Facility is $1,695.00 million. The Revolving Credit Facility 
includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the borrowing capacity of the 
Revolving Credit Facility to up to $2,542.50 million. We amended and restated the Revolving Credit Facility on numerous occasions 
between October 3, 2014 and June 24, 2025. 
Borrowings denominated in USD, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest (at our election) of either (i) Term 
SOFR plus a margin of either (x) 2.00%, (y) 1.875% (subject to maintenance of certain long-term corporate debt ratings) or (z) 1.75% 
(subject to certain gross borrowing base conditions), in each case, plus an additional 0.10% credit adjustment spread, or (ii) an alternative 
base rate, which is the highest of (i) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day plus 1/2 of 
1.00% and (iii) the rate per annum equal to (x) the greater of (A) Term SOFR for an interest period of one (1) month and (B) zero plus (y) 
1.00%, plus a margin of either (x) 1.00%, (y) 0.875% (subject to maintenance of certain long-term corporate debt ratings) or (z) 0.75% 
(subject to certain gross borrowing base conditions). Borrowings denominated in non-USD bear interest of the applicable term benchmark 
rate or the applicable risk-free rate (“RFR rate”) plus a margin of either 2.00%, 1.875% or 1.75% (subject to the conditions applicable to 
borrowings denominated in USD that bear interest based on the applicable term benchmark rate or the applicable RFR rate), plus, (i) in the 
case of borrowings denominated in GBP only, an additional 0.1193% credit adjustment spread, (ii) in the case of borrowings denominated 
in CHF only, an additional 0.0031% and (iii) in the case of borrowings denominated in CAD only, an additional 0.29547% (one-month 
interest period) or an additional 0.32138% (three-month interest period) credit adjustment spread. Borrowings from certain lenders, which 
hold approximately 84% of total lending commitments (the "Extending Lenders"), bear interest at the applicable rates described above less 
0.10%. With respect to borrowings denominated in USD, we may elect either Term SOFR, or an alternative base rate at the time of

borrowing, and such borrowings may be converted from one benchmark to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. Interest is 
payable in arrears on the applicable interest payment date as specified therein. We pay a fee of 0.375% per annum on committed but 
undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, 

Table of Contents

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We may become a party to investment commitments and to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our 
business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to 
extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. 
As of June 30, 2025, we believed that we had adequate financial resources to satisfy our unfunded commitments. Our unfunded 
commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies were as follows:

HEDGING 
Subject to applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and applicable Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) 
regulations, we may enter into hedging transactions in a manner consistent with SEC guidance. To the extent that any of our loans are 
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, we may enter into currency hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in 
currency exchange rates. We may also enter into interest rate hedging agreements. Such hedging activities, which will be subject to 
compliance with applicable legal requirements, may include the use of futures, options, swaps and forward contracts. Costs incurred in 
entering into such contracts or in settling them, if any, will be borne by us. Our Investment Adviser has claimed relief from CFTC 

80
 
 
registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 with respect to our operations, with the result that we 
will be limited in our ability to use futures contracts or options on futures contracts or engage in swap transactions. Specifically, CFTC 
Rule 4.5 imposes strict limitations on using such derivatives other than for hedging purposes, whereby the use of derivatives not used 
solely for hedging purposes is generally limited to situations where (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish 
such positions does not exceed five percent of the 

Table of Contents
liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts it has entered 
into; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such derivatives does not exceed 100% of the liquidation value of our portfolio. Moreover, 
we anticipate entering into transactions involving such derivatives to a very limited extent solely for hedging purposes or otherwise within 
the limitations of CFTC Rule 4.5.
Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act includes limitations on the ability of a BDC (or a RIC) to use derivatives and other 
transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations (including reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing 
transactions). Under the rule, BDCs that make significant use of derivatives are subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, a derivatives risk 
management program, testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These requirements apply unless the BDC 
qualifies as a “limited derivatives user,” as defined in Rule 18f-4. Under the rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment 
agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among 
other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet 
its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Under Rule 18f-4, when we 
trade reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, including certain tender option bonds, we need to aggregate the 
amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness (e.g., bank borrowings, if applicable) when calculating our asset coverage 
ratio. We currently operate as a “limited derivatives user” and these requirements may limit our ability to use derivatives and/or enter into 
certain other financial contracts. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, 
which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic 
environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. 
For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 “Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements 
included in this report. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Investments, Revenue Recognition, 
Non-Accrual Investments, Distributions, and Income Taxes. We consider the most significant critical estimate to be the fair value 
measurement of investments. The critical accounting policies and estimate should be read in connection with our risk factors listed under 
“Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Fair Value Measurement of Investments 
Consistent with GAAP and the Investment Company Act, we conduct a valuation of our investments, pursuant to which our NAV is 
determined. Our investments are valued on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the Investment Company Act. The 
determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. The majority of investments are not quoted or traded in an active 
market and as such their fair values are determined using valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, market multiples, and 
recent comparable transactions. The most significant inputs in applying the discounted cash flow approach and the market multiples 
approach are the selected discount rates and multiples, respectively. The selection of these inputs is based on a combination of factors that 
are specific to the underlying portfolio companies such as financial performance and certain factors that are observable in the market such 
as current interest rates and comparable public company trading multiples. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations and any change in these valuations on the consolidated 
financial statements. For further details of our investments and fair value measurement accounting policy, see Note 2 “Significant 
Accounting Policies—Investments” and Note 5 “Fair Value Measurement.”

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our 
earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with 
borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at 
which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse 
effect on our net investment income. 
As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, on a fair value basis, approximately 0.6% and 0.6% of our performing debt investments bore 
interest at a fixed rate (including income producing preferred stock investments), and approximately 99.4% and 99.4% of our performing 
debt investments bore interest at a floating rate. Our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate and our 
2026 Notes and 2027 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate. 
We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing 
basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. 
Based on our June 30, 2025 Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, the following table shows the annual impact on net income 
of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment 
and borrowing structure:

We may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward 
contracts subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, applicable CFTC regulations and in a manner consistent with SEC 
guidance. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate 
in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. 
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an 
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the 
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 
Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure 
controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2025. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, 
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable 
assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls 
and procedures relative to their costs.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that 
occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to 
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION.
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the 
enforcement of our rights under loans to or other contracts with our portfolio companies. We are not currently subject to any material legal 
proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously reported 
under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was filed with the SEC 
on February 27, 2025. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may 
materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.
We did not sell any unregistered equity securities.
On August 8, 2024, our Board of Directors approved and authorized a 10b5-1 stock repurchase program which allows us to repurchase up 
to $75.00 million of shares of our common stock if our common stock trades below the most recently announced quarter-end NAV per 
share, subject to certain limitations. On June 13, 2025, we entered into the 2025 10b5-1 Plan with Georgeson for repurchases of our 
common stock during the period from June 16, 2025 through June 13, 2026. Unless extended by the Board, the 2025 10b5-1 Plan will 
terminate 12 months from the date it was entered into. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, repurchases under the 2025 
10b5-1 Plan were as follows:
