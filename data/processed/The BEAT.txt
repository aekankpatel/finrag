Policy Support Helps Markets Look Through Softness in 1Q26
The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Solutions Group at the time of writing of this presentation and are subject to change at any time due to market, economic or other conditions, and may not 
necessarily come to pass. Not to be construed as an investment or research recommendation.
TOP VIEWS
The soft patch in data that began in 2025 will likely spill over into 1Q 2026, before improving sometime in the 2Q. Policy 
support will be in place to offset softer data, via tax relief and monetary easing, and the Fed may still ease policy further. 
More importantly, deregulation could potentially unlock significant lending capacity across the U.S., U.K. and Europe. 
Follow the Policy: Deregulation To Support Financials
The old saying is “follow the money,” but we say “follow 
the policy” because it's an early tell on where the money 
is going. Banks and financials are positioned as primary 
beneficiaries of deregulation, which began in 2025 and 
is expected to be codified in early 2026. The U.S. is the 
largest beneficiary with $2.6 trillion in lending capacity 
to be unlocked, followed by the U.K. and Europe, where 
regulations are easing, too. As a result, we remain O/W 
U.S. and European banks.
Consensus Is Positive, Which Begs the Question…
Can markets move higher? Yes, as we expect a stronger 
recovery in 2Q26. Monetary and fiscal policy in 2025 
should gain traction, supported by improved operating 
leverage and a recovery in labor markets that helps 
support demand. We believe markets will continue to look 
through to 2H26, with earnings remaining strong. This, 
in turn, may trigger a broader cyclical recovery that sees 
higher valuations. 
When Spreads Are Tight, Rate Risks Rise
Fed cuts may come in early 2026, but if there is a 2H26 
recovery, we may need to think about hikes in the U.S., 
U.K. and Europe being priced in. Since credit spreads are 
tight, there is little room for compression to cushion rising 
yields, thus risk in bond portfolios needs to be actively 
managed. Selection matters too: We like non-
agency mortgager-backed securities (MBS) and asset-
backed securities (ABS) because they’re better priced to 
absorb higher rates and better valued.
The Risks: Inflation and Geopolitical
Inflation is a clear risk, if we see rising prices due to policy 
support or an event that disrupts supply chains. 
Aggressive policy support in 2026 is welcome if inflation 
remains contained or falls; however, if inflation rises, 
such support could become problematic, as it would 
be a difficult source of issues to reverse. Geopolitical 
conflicts could also lead to sanctions, tariffs 
and supply disruptions.

ASSET ALLOCATION
COMMENTARY
Bonds
Duration
DURATION (U/W): UST 10-year yields have continued to trade modestly above 4% for the past several months. 
We continue to believe 4% represents the floor given the growth tailwinds still to come in 2026. Risks are tilted to the 
upside for yields and therefore we remain U/W duration.
Credit
CREDIT (U/W): While fundamentals remain largely stable, corporate credit spreads are near all-time tights such that 
we see more favorable risk/reward asymmetry elsewhere. We prefer selective exposure to higher yielding credit 
(MBS, Bank Loans).
Equities
Risk Level
EQUITIES (Neutral): We remain neutral to overall equity exposure, but are increasingly optimistic about 2026. 
Regionally, we remain overweight the U.S., where we see structural support for equities in the form of fiscal policy, 
monetary policy and productivity gains linked to AI.
Alternatives
Commodities
COMMODITIES (Neutral): We remain neutral on energy, as geopolitical upside risks are balanced by high spare 
capacity in markets such as crude, which limit upside absent physical disruptions. In the current environment, we 
continue to see precious metals as a segment that could enjoy structural tailwinds.

COMMENTARY
Bonds
U.S. Treasuries (USTs)
USTs (U/W): With UST 10-year yields near 4%, rates are likely too low relative to the economic outlook in the U.S., 
where growing tailwinds support a reacceleration in 2026. The combination of stronger growth and sticky inflation 
likely skews the Fed to fewer cuts than what is currently priced in over the next 12 months.
Inflation-Linked Bonds
Inflation-Linked Bonds (O/W): We continue to see some value in this space, particularly on the longer sections of 
the curve should inflation remain sticky or even reaccelerate in 2026. 
Eurozone Govt. Bonds
Eurozone Govt. Bonds (U/W): Despite inflation falling towards target, we think long-end yields in the eurozone could 
continue to rise, as Germany’s fiscal spending exerts steepening pressure on yield curves. In the eurozone, we 
remain O/W Spain and Portugal on the back of more favorable growth and debt dynamics.
EM Hard Currency Govt. Bonds
EM Hard Currency (O/W): We remain O/W EMD despite spreads being near all-time tights. Default prospects appear 
lower than in corporate credit while quality-adjusted spreads remain higher. 
EM Local Currency Govt. Bonds
EM Local Currency (Neutral): EM Local continues to perform well in USD, but has not been great in other currencies, 
such as EUR. This supports our view that EM Local rates and currencies are fairly valued, but a view on the base 
currency may be more impactful for near-term returns.
Public Credit
Municipal Bonds
Municipal Bonds (Neutral): Muni/UST ratios remain at YTD tight levels. We still like the asset class for taxable 
investors but would hold our neutral stance.
Investment Grade (IG)
Investment Grade (U/W): With spreads near all-time tights, IG has poor convexity in the current environment.
MBS/ABS
MBS/ABS (O/W): Asset-backed securities remain our highest conviction fixed income overweight. Yield per unit of 
credit quality remains attractive, and the asset class continues to benefit from structural tailwinds. 
High Yield (HY)
High Yield (Neutral): We remain neutral. While fundamental trends within HY remain solid, we view the risk/reward 
asymmetry for the asset class as unfavorable with spreads trading near all-time tights. As such, we see more 
attractive opportunities elsewhere within credit markets.
Bank Loans
Bank Loans (O/W): We remain O/W Bank Loans given our positive fundamental view on growth entering 2026 along 
with the high carry associated with the asset class. Additionally, we believe loans should benefit from a repricing in 
the front-end of the curve, which we feel is too aggressively pricing in rate cuts based on this outlook.

EQUITY
COMMENTARY
Regional
U.S.
United States (O/W): Strength in 3Q25 earnings, coupled with continued resilience in growth, reinforces our positive 
view on U.S. equities. We continue to expect a reacceleration in growth in 2026, with tailwinds still to come in the 
form of monetary stimulus, fiscal stimulus, deregulation and continued AI adoption. 
Eurozone
Europe (Neutral): We continue to hold a positive view on structural trends in Europe, but earnings revisions at the 
broad index level continue to lag other regions. As such, we opt for a more targeted approach to exposure 
and retain our O/W in eurozone banks and German mid-caps, as well as an O/W in utilities.
Japan
Japan (Neutral): Japanese equities are supported by fiscal stimulus, improved corporate governance, domestic 
reflation and BoJ policy normalization, while U.S. tariff uncertainty has eased. Returns should be steady, although 
Yen appreciation and rising bond yields need to be watched as potential headwinds.
Emerging Markets
Emerging Markets (Neutral): EM is supported by resilient global growth, range-bound USD, benign inflation, Fed 
easing and a US-China trade truce. Weaker domestic conditions in China and restrained stimulus pose downside 
risks. Asia’s tech supply chain continues to benefit from the global AI investment cycle but with increased volatility. 
India is muddling through a domestic soft patch amid AI headwinds and unresolved U.S. tariff overhang.
Style
Growth vs. Value
Growth vs. Value (Neutral): Since mid-2022 the Growth vs. Value trade has been dictated primarily by high-beta 
tech exposure with Growth-style indexes outperforming Value as markets rise and underperforming as they fall. In 
this context, a broadly neutral view on equities suggests a neutral view on Growth vs. Value. 
Large-Cap vs. Small-Cap
Large Cap (O/W): We retain a preference for Large-Caps in the U.S. alongside a view of two-sided risks in the largest 
index weights. We take selective SMID exposure in both the U.S. and Europe where we see structural growth 
tailwinds supporting upside potential.
Cyclical vs. Defensive Sectors
Cyclicals (O/W): Our cyclical exposure in the U.S. and Europe rests mainly on structural drivers from policy efforts.

Improved M&A activity: While distributions in 2025 
remained near record lows, there is a positive M&A 
momentum.
Buyout valuations remain attractive, particularly versus 
public: 10-11x vs. 14-15x in public.
AI consolidates: Transactions were +50% of the VC 
market in 1H25, but at 3-4x higher valuations than 2023.

Terms
Yield to Worst is a measure which reflects the lowest potential yield earned on a bond without the issuer 
defaulting. The yield to worst is calculated by making worst-case scenario assumptions by calculating the 
returns that would be received if provisions, including prepayment, call or sinking fund, are used by the issuer.
About Risk
Bank Loans – There can be no assurance that the liquidation of collateral securing an investment will satisfy 
the issuer’s obligation in the event of non-payment or that collateral can be readily liquidated. The ability to 
realize the benefits of any collateral may be delayed or limited. Commodities – The value of commodities 
investments will generally be affected by overall market movements and factors specific to a particular industry 
or commodity including weather, embargoes, tariffs, or health, political, international and regulatory 
developments. Credit – Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness 
of the issuer and are subject to the risk of non-payment of principal and interest. The value of income securities 
also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer’s ability to make principal and interest 
payments. Duration – Securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than 
securities with shorter durations. Equity – Equity investment values are sensitive to stock market volatility. 
Foreign – Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. 
investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical, or other conditions. In 
emerging countries, these risks may be more significant. Gov’t Agency – While certain U.S. Government-
sponsored agencies may be chartered or sponsored by acts of Congress, their securities are neither issued 
nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Income Market – An imbalance in supply and demand in the income 
market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a 
lack of price transparency in the market. There generally is limited public information about Municipal issuers. 
Inflation-Linked – Interest payments on inflation-linked securities may vary widely and will fluctuate as 
principal and interest are adjusted for inflation. Investments in inflation-linked securities may lose value in the 
event that the actual rate of inflation is different than the rate of the inflation index. Interest Rate – As interest 
rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline.. Lower-Rated – Investments rated below 
Investment Grade (typically referred to as “junk”) are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity 
than higher rated investments. Maturity – Longer-term bonds typically are more sensitive to interest rate 
changes than shorter-term bonds. Preferred Stocks – When interest rates rise, the value of preferred stocks 
will generally decline. Prepayment - MBS – Mortgage-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk. 
Prepayment - Bank Loan – Bank Loans are subject to prepayment risk. Real Estate – Changes in real estate 
values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry, 
including REITs.

Risk Considerations 
Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss.
In general, equity securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a 
company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, 
economic, and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater 
than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Fixed income 
securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest 
payments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the creditworthiness of 
the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a rising interest-rate environment, 
bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio 
redemptions. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less 
income. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Alternative 
investments are speculative, involve a high degree of risk, are highly illiquid, typically have 
higher fees than other investments, and may engage in the use of leverage, short sales, and 
derivatives, which may increase the risk of investment loss. These investments are 
designed for investors who understand and are willing to accept these risks. Performance 
may be volatile, and an investor could lose all or a substantial portion of its investment.
There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will work under all market conditions, 
and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest for the long-term, especially during 
periods of downturn in the market. 
A separately managed account may not be appropriate for all investors. Separate 
accounts managed according to the Strategy include a number of securities and will 
not necessarily track the performance of any index. Please consider the investment 
objectives, risks and fees of the Strategy carefully before investing. A minimum asset 
level is required.
