NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(Unaudited) 
 
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles 
Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, the unaudited 
interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a 
fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results 
for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the 
Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2025 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 30, 
2025.
We have recast certain prior period amounts on our consolidated cash flows statements to conform to the current 
period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, 
consolidated income statements, or net cash from (used in) operations, investing, or financing on our consolidated 
cash flows statements.
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany 
transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
Estimates and Assumptions 
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue 
recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the 
standalone selling price of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product 
returns and refunds; loss contingencies; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful 
accounts; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the 
potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax 
returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ 
from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.
Financial Instruments
Investments
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of 
purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, 
investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are 
classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term 
based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is 
available for current operations.

PART I
Item 1
 
Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific 
identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other 
comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates 
determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, 
general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than 
cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and 
qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business 
outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell 
the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other 
income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee 
conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are generally measured at fair value. Equity investments that 
are not recorded at fair value are measured using the equity method of accounting when required or measured at cost 
with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). For 
equity investments recorded at fair value, we perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an 
impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in 
fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Equity method investments may be recorded on a lag of up to 
three months when sufficient financial information is not available in a timely manner. For equity method investments 
recorded on a lag, we recognize the impact of intervening events that have a material impact on our consolidated 
financial statements in the period in which they occurred. 
Investments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are evaluated to determine whether we are the 
primary beneficiary of the VIE, in which case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We evaluate whether we 
have (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the 
obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments. Therefore, our VIE investments 
are not consolidated and the majority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
We have a long-term strategic partnership with OpenAI. In October 2025, we signed a new definitive agreement with 
OpenAI that extends this partnership. Additionally, OpenAI formed a public benefit corporation and completed a 
recapitalization (“OpenAI Recapitalization”). We have an investment of approximately 27 percent of OpenAI on an as-
converted basis accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the OpenAI Recapitalization, we 
had a decrease in our proportionate ownership of OpenAI and recorded a dilution gain in other income (expense), net. 
Refer to Note 3 – Other Income (Expense), Net for additional information. We calculate our equity method income or 
loss using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method because our liquidation rights and priorities differ 
from our underlying ownership interest. Under the HLBV method, we recognize income or loss based on the change in 
the amount we would receive if the net assets of the investee were distributed at book value. We have made total 
funding commitments of $13 billion, of which $11.7 billion has been funded as of December 31, 2025.
Derivatives
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for 
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income 
(expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components 
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of 
other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding 
hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are 
recognized in other income (expense), net.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are 

9
primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.

PART I
Item 1
 
Fair Value Measurements
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on 
the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair 
value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement in its entirety. These levels are:
•
Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our 
Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. 
Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.
•
Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for 
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. 
the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated 
by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these 
models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based 
observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and 
spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. 
agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and 
bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap 
contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.
•
Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions 
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined 
using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 
3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill 
and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable 
inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of 
these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include 
quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.
Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.
Contract Balances and Other Receivables 
As of December 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, 
was $5.3 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance 
sheets.
As of December 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server 
components were $15.1 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our 
consolidated balance sheets.
We record financing receivables when we offer certain customers the option to acquire our software products and 
services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of December 31, 2025 and June 30, 
2025, our financing receivables, net were $2.7 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term 
financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated 
balance sheets. 
We record an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of credit losses inherent in the accounts 
receivable and financing receivable balances. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, 
historical experience, and other currently available evidence.

Recent Accounting Guidance
Income Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new standard to improve income tax 
disclosures. The guidance requires additional disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid and prescribes 
standardized categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation. We will adopt the standard on the 
effective date in our annual reporting for fiscal year 2026. The standard can be applied either prospectively or 
retrospectively. 
Income Statement – Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
In November 2024, the FASB issued a new standard to expand disclosures about income statement expenses. The 
guidance requires disaggregation of certain costs and expenses included in each relevant expense caption on our 
consolidated income statements in a separate note to the financial statements at each interim and annual reporting 
period, including amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset 
amortization. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2028 and interim 
periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our 
disclosures. 
NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock 
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common 
stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. 
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. 
The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:

Refer to Note 5 – Derivatives for further information on the fair value of our derivative instruments.
Equity investments presented as “Other” in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair 
values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, measured using the equity 
method, or measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair 
value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025, equity investments without readily determinable fair 
values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $5.0 billion and $2.9 
billion, respectively, and equity investments measured using the equity method were $11.5 billion and $6.0 billion, 
respectively.

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to 
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include 
reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our 
derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
Foreign Currencies 

15
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign 
currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. 

PART I
Item 1
 
Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts 
that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign 
exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. 
Interest Rate 
Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair 
value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We 
manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-
based fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging 
instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.
Equity 
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, 
futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
Credit 
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default 
swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. 
These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features 
Certain counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding 
long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of 
$1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the 
standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of December 31, 2025, our long-term unsecured debt 
rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be 
posted.

NOTE 10 — INCOME TAXES
Effective Tax Rate
Our effective tax rate was 20% for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2025, and 18% for both the 
three and six months ended December 31, 2024. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three and six months 
ended December 31, 2025 compared to the prior year was primarily due to deferred tax expense attributable to the 
dilution gain from the OpenAI Recapitalization and changes in the mix of our earnings and tax expenses between the 
U.S. and foreign countries.
Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 
2025, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our 
products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As of December 31, 2025 and June 30, 2025, unrecognized tax benefits and other income tax liabilities were $28.7 
billion and $27.4 billion, respectively, and are included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets.
We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on 
September 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the 
NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 
billion plus penalties and interest. As of December 31, 2025, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies 
are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s 
administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues 
in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or 
decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. 
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S., some of which are currently under audit by local 
tax authorities. The resolution of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. 
Our operations in Ireland remain subject to examination for tax years 2021 and thereafter.

Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts expected to 
be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $631 billion as of December 31, 2025. Estimating 
revenue that will be allocated to remaining performance obligations can involve significant judgments, including 
identifying and assessing variable consideration and potential renegotiation of commitments. We consider factors such 
as the nature of the terms and duration of the contract across our portfolio of contracts. Revenue allocated to remaining 
performance obligations related to the commercial portion of revenue was $625 billion as of December 31, 2025, with a 
weighted average duration of approximately 2.5 years. We expect to recognize approximately 25% of both our total 
company remaining performance obligation revenue and commercial remaining performance obligation revenue over 
the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.
NOTE 12 — LEASES
We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft 
Experience Centers, and certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 20 years, 
some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate 
the leases within 1 year.

NOTE 13 — CONTINGENCIES
Irish Data Protection Commission Matter
In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether 
LinkedIn’s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection 
Regulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In October 2024, the IDPC provided 
LinkedIn with a final decision alleging GDPR violations and assessing a fine. In November 2024, LinkedIn appealed the 

23
final decision to the Irish courts. A preliminary hearing was held in December 2025.

PART I
Item 1
 
Other Contingencies
We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our 
business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will 
not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent 
uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.
As of December 31, 2025, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $575 million. While we intend to defend these 
matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $400 million in aggregate beyond 
recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a 
material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably 
estimable.
NOTE 14 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Share Repurchases
On September 14, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $60.0 billion in 
share repurchases. This share repurchase program commenced in November 2021 and was completed in April 2025.
On September 16, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $60.0 billion in

NOTE 16 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is also our 
Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements. 
The primary profitability measure used by the CODM to review segment operating results is operating income. The 
CODM uses operating income to allocate resources during our annual planning process and throughout the year, as 
well as to assess the performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual results compared to prior periods 
and expected results. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following 
segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

25

PART I
Item 1
 
Our reportable segments are described below.
Productivity and Business Processes
Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, 
communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily 
comprises:
•
Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud, 
comprising Microsoft 365 Commercial, Enterprise Mobility + Security, the cloud portion of Windows 
Commercial, the per-user portion of Power BI, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 
Security and Compliance, and Microsoft 365 Copilot; and Microsoft 365 Commercial products, comprising 
Windows Commercial on-premises and Office licensed on-premises. 
•
Microsoft 365 Consumer products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, 
Office licensed on-premises, and other consumer services.
•
LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.
•
Dynamics products and cloud services, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based 
applications across ERP, CRM, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM 
applications.
Intelligent Cloud
Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that power 
modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:
•
Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services, comprising cloud and AI 
consumption-based services, GitHub cloud services, Nuance Healthcare cloud services, virtual desktop 
offerings, and other cloud services; and Server products, comprising SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual 
Studio, System Center, related Client Access Licenses, and other on-premises offerings.
•
Enterprise and partner services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions, Nuance 
professional services, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.
More Personal Computing
Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the 
experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:
•
Windows and Devices, including Windows OEM licensing (Windows Pro and non-Pro licenses sold through 
the OEM channel) and Devices, comprising Surface and PC accessories.
•
Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content 
(including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, 
advertising, and other cloud services.
•
Search and news advertising, comprising Bing and Copilot, Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party 
affiliates.
Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our 
business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from 
certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, 
which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a 
profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating 
expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple 
segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

26

PART I
Item 1
 
27
In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs 
generally include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise 
taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support, and severance incurred as part of a 
corporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs 
being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount.
Segment revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and operating income were as follows during the periods 
presented:

Our Microsoft Cloud revenue, which includes Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud, Azure and other cloud services, the 
commercial portion of LinkedIn, and Dynamics 365, was $51.5 billion and $100.6 billion for the three and six months 
ended December 31, 2025, respectively, and $40.9 billion and $79.8 billion for the three and six months ended 
December 31, 2024, respectively. These amounts are included in Server products and cloud services, Microsoft 365 
Commercial products and cloud services, LinkedIn, and Dynamics products and cloud services in the table above.
Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is 
included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment. It is impracticable for us to separately

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation
 
Results of Review of Interim Financial Information
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the 
"Company") as of December 31, 2025, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for the three-month and six-month periods ended December 31, 2025 and 
2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial information”). Based on our reviews, 
we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial 
information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America.
 
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2025, and the 
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for the 
year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated July 30, 2025, we expressed an unqualified 
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying 
consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2025, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the 
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
 
Basis for Review Results
This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting 
firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance 
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.
 
We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information 
consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial 
and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards 
of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as 
a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

operating results that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including the following sections: “Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” (Part II, Item 1A of this

OVERVIEW
Microsoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence (“AI”) available 
broadly and doing so responsibly, with a mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to 
achieve more. We create platforms and tools, powered by AI, that deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving 
needs of our customers. 
We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and 
businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global 
audience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; 
supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, 
marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.

Industry Trends and Opportunities
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each 
industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the 
industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research 
and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry 
trends, and competitive forces.
We have a long-term strategic partnership with OpenAI which was originally established in 2019. In October 2025, we 
signed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI that extends this partnership and continues to build on our shared 
vision to advance artificial intelligence responsibly and make its benefits broadly accessible. Microsoft is a major 
investor in OpenAI, and the companies have reciprocal revenue-sharing arrangements. We hold rights to OpenAI’s 
intellectual property, including models and infrastructure, for integration into our products. 
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are 
developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and 
businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in 
the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for 
our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain 
dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.
The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs 
and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter 
locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing 
demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, 
networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units and other components. Our devices are primarily 
manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other 
manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our 
products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these 
suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and 
industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, 
broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and 
businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.
Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue 
and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates 
may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies 
increased reported revenue and did not have a material impact on reported expenses from our international operations 
for the three and six months ended December 31, 2025.
Further, global, regional, and local economic developments and changes in global trade policies such as restrictions on 
international trade, including tariffs and other controls on imports or exports, could result in increased supply chain 
challenges, cost volatility, and consumer and economic uncertainty which may adversely affect our results of 
operations.
Refer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.
Seasonality
Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue 
is driven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period.

Item 2
 
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to 
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of 
derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.
Other income (expense), net included $10.0 billion and $5.9 billion of net gains for the three and six months ended 
December 31, 2025, respectively, and $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion of net losses for the three and six months ended 
December 31, 2024, respectively, from investments in OpenAI, primarily net recognized gains (losses) on our equity 
method investment reflected in Other, net. The net gains recorded for the three and six months ended December 31, 
2025 primarily relate to the dilution gain from the OpenAI Recapitalization.
Three Months Ended December 31, 2025 Compared with Three Months Ended December 31, 2024
Interest and dividends income increased primarily due to higher portfolio balances and higher yields on debt securities. 
Interest expense increased primarily due to higher finance lease interest expense, offset in part by higher capitalization 
of debt interest expense. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to lower impairments and higher 
gains on equity securities in the current period. Net gains on derivatives increased primarily due to gains on equity 
derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the prior period. Other, net primarily reflects net recognized 
gains (losses) on equity method investments, including OpenAI.
Six Months Ended December 31, 2025 Compared with Six Months Ended December 31, 2024
Interest and dividends income increased primarily due to higher portfolio balances and higher yields on debt securities. 
Interest expense increased primarily due to higher finance lease interest expense, offset in part by higher capitalization 
of debt interest expense. Net recognized losses on investments decreased primarily due to lower impairments, offset in 
part by losses on equity securities in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period. Net gains on 
derivatives increased primarily due to gains on equity derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the 
prior period. Other, net primarily reflects net recognized gains (losses) on equity method investments, including 
OpenAI.
INCOME TAXES
Effective Tax Rate
Our effective tax rate was 20% for both the three and six months ended December 31, 2025, and 18% for both the 
three and six months ended December 31, 2024. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three and six months 
ended December 31, 2025 compared to the prior year was primarily due to deferred tax expense attributable to the 
dilution gain from the OpenAI Recapitalization and changes in the mix of our earnings and tax expenses between the 
U.S. and foreign countries.
Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 
2025, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our 
products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.
Uncertain Tax Positions
We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on 
September 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the 
NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 
billion plus penalties and interest. As of December 31, 2025, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies 
are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s 
administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues 
in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or 
decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S., some of which are currently under audit by local 
tax authorities. The resolution of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. 

40
Our operations in Ireland remain subject to examination for tax years 2021 and thereafter.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Adjusted other income (expense), net, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial 
measures which exclude net (gains) losses from investments in OpenAI. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid 
investors by providing additional insight into our financial performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. 
For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results 
in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a 
substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital 
markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing 
activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 
12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $89.5 billion and $94.6 billion as of December 31, 2025 
and June 30, 2025, respectively. Equity and other investments were $21.2 billion and $15.4 billion as of December 31, 
2025 and June 30, 2025, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and 
capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified 
among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but 
also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to 
interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to 
achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these 
investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-
income securities.

PART I
Item 2

Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine 
the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. 
government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities 
or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies 
to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign 
government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 
3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured 
at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these 
vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without 
applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is 
not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the 
investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker 
prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-
priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for 
these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are 
recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period 
fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows
Cash from operations increased $24.3 billion to $80.8 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2025, primarily 
due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers. Cash used 
in financing increased $1.6 billion to $29.4 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2025, primarily due to a $4.0 
billion increase in common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $3.7 billion decrease in cash used for repayments of 
debt. Cash used in investing increased $28.0 billion to $57.3 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2025, 
primarily due to an $18.5 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, a $5.9 billion increase in other 
investing to facilitate the purchase of components, and a $5.7 billion increase in cash used in net investment 
purchases, sales, and maturities.
Debt Proceeds
We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The 
proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other 
things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of 
existing debt. Refer to Note 9 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include cloud 
services and Software Assurance (“SA”). Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each 
contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also 
includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer 
control of the product or service.

If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-
based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to 
being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Refer to Note 11 – Unearned 
Revenue of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).
Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
Share Repurchases
For the six months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 20 million shares and 15 million shares of 
our common stock for $9.9 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase program. All repurchases 
were made using cash resources. As of December 31, 2025, $47.4 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase 
program. Refer to Note 14 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-
Q).
Dividends
For the six months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, our Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $13.5 
billion and $12.3 billion, respectively. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, 
subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 14 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial 
Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of 
technology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will 
continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and 
marketing, support, and administrative staff. We will continue to invest in capital expenditures to support growth in our 
cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure and training. We have operating and finance leases for 
datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain 
equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or 
other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing 
consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 

43
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a 
significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of 
operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment 
securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, and income taxes.

PART I
Item 2
 
Revenue Recognition
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. 
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted 
for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-
premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is 
considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and 
recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, 
interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for 
together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the 
cloud services are provided.
Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. We 
use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with 
SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell 
each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based 
on the relative SSP of the various products and services.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we 
determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically 
have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by 
customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and 
geographic region in determining the SSP.
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of 
delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.
Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain 
instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration 
when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and 
updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated 
variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.
Remaining performance obligations represent the revenue we expect to recognize for our products and services for 
which control has not yet been transferred to customers. We estimate total consideration to be received at the outset of 
the agreement and throughout the term of the agreement. Estimating the total consideration and revenue that will be 
allocated to remaining performance obligation can involve significant judgments, including identifying and assessing 
variable consideration and potential renegotiation of commitments. We consider factors such as the nature of the terms 
and duration of the contract across our portfolio of contracts.
Impairment of Investment Securities
We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair 
value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the 
extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this 
judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in 
evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the 
financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than 
not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an 
impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, 
industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment 
indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a 
qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine 

44
the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is 
recorded in other income (expense), net.

PART I
Item 2
 
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. 
We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value 
allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below 
an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances 
change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events 
or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance 
indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment 
of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value 
of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash 
flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is 
dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life 
over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, 
market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the 
determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a software product to be marketed or sold to external users are 
charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is 
established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is 
required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that 
technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved 
through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The 
amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. 
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated 
loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that 
an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In 
determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an 
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors 
could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the 
current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been 
recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position 
only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on 
the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are 
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate 
settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, 
classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax 
positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that 
have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these 
future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
RISKS
We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use 
derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currencies
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign 
currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. 
Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.
Interest Rate
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We 
manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global 
fixed-income indices.
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit 
exposures relative to broad-based indices to facilitate portfolio diversification.
Equity
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Refer to Note 13 – Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information 
regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that 
could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and the trading price 
of our common stock.
STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS
We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which could adversely affect 
our results of operations.
Competition in the technology sector
Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources 
to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, 
marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which 
we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of 
new products and services. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products, devices, and services that appeal 
to businesses and consumers, we may not remain competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial 
condition, and results of operations.
Competition among platform-based ecosystems
An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many 
participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, 
application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the 
marketplace is necessary to meet consumer demand and to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face 
significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.
•
A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the hardware and software elements 
of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as PCs, tablets, 
smartphones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model 
also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications 
and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and 
performance benefits from their vertically-integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware 
and software products and services. Shifting a portion of our business to a vertically-integrated model may 
increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.
•
We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant 
competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones 
and tablets. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device 
and its platform. Users continue to turn to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed 
by PCs. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a PC, the prevalence of these devices 
may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing 
with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular 
products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, 
some of our devices compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment 
to our platform.

47

PART II
Item 1A
 
•
Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. 
The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing 
decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching 
platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and 
ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete 
with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our 
operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our 
ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model 
objectives.
For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which 
could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
Business model competition
Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.
•
A material part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing 
devices. We and our competitors continue to devote significant resources to developing and deploying 
cloud-based strategies and services for consumers and business customers, and pricing and delivery 
models are evolving.
•
We are investing in artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the entire company and infusing generative AI 
capabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings. AI technology and services are a highly competitive 
and rapidly evolving market, and new competitors continue to enter the market. We will bear significant 
development and operational costs to build and support the AI models, services, platforms, and 
infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be 
responsive to technological change, new and potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.
•
Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business 
models, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software 
revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in 
research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. 
Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.
•
Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by 
selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these 
competitors provide to users at little or no cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.
•
Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open-source software at little or no 
cost to end users, developing, making available, or using AI models that are open, and earning revenue on 
advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and 
development for the open-source products. Some open-source products mimic the features and functionality 
of our products.
The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased 
operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives, which could adversely affect 
our financial condition and results of operations.
Our focus on cloud-based and AI services presents execution and competitive risks. We are incurring significant 
costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud-based and AI services, reducing operating margins. Whether 
we succeed in cloud-based and AI services depends on our execution in several areas, including:
•
Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based and AI services and products that generate increasing 
traffic and market share.
•
Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based and AI services on the growing 
array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices.

48

PART II
Item 1A
 
•
Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.
•
Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations and specific requirements of our 
customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.
•
Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and 
ecosystems, including those of our competitors.
It is uncertain whether our strategies will continue to attract users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we 
are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or 
if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the 
infrastructure and development investments described above. This could adversely affect our operations, financial 
condition, and results of operations.
Our AI systems offer users powerful tools and capabilities. However, there may be instances where these systems are 
used in ways that are unintended or inappropriate. In addition, some users may also engage in fraudulent or abusive 
activities through our cloud-based and AI services, such as unauthorized account access, payment fraud, or terms of 
service violations including cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. While we are committed to detecting and 
controlling such misuse of our cloud-based and AI services, our efforts may not be effective, and we may incur 
reputational damage or experience adverse impacts to our business and results of operations.
RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS
We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will 
continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and 
technologies, including AI-based products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety 
of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, and gaming devices. 
Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovation, 
developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as 
providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware 
products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, 
service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be 
profitable or may not achieve operating margins as high as we have experienced historically. We may not get 
engagement in certain features that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data-handling practices across our 
products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity 
or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature 
adoption. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. We could 
experience significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services. These 
factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances could have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to 
continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business 
strategy. For example, in October 2023 we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. We have a long-term 
strategic partnership with OpenAI, and in October 2025 we announced a significant update to this partnership. 
Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do 
not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new 
compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, 
business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced 
transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and 
interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. We also have limited ability to 
control or influence third parties with whom we have arrangements, which may impact our ability to realize the 
anticipated benefits. The success of these transactions and arrangements depend in part on our ability to leverage 
them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as the acquired 
companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, digital safety, 
responsible AI, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full economic benefits from these 
transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be 

49
smaller than we expected, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles.

PART II
Item 1A
 
50
We have recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial 
statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, 
negatively affecting our results of operations. In addition, an acquisition may be subject to challenge even after it has 
been completed. These events could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of 
operations.
CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS
Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or 
harm to our reputation or competitive position.
Security of our information technology
Threats to security can take a variety of forms. Threat actors, including individual and groups of hackers and 
sophisticated organizations, including nation-states, state-sponsored organizations, or cybercriminal groups, 
continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our internal infrastructure, and we have 
experienced cybersecurity incidents in which such actors have gained unauthorized access to our systems and data, 
including customer systems and data. These actors use a wide variety of methods, which include developing and 
deploying malicious software; exploiting known and potential vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in our 
or third-party hardware, software, or other infrastructure to attack our products and services or gain access to our 
networks and datacenters; using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers 
to disclose sensitive information, such as passwords, or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or 
customers’ data; or acting in a coordinated manner or conducting coordinated attacks. For example, as previously 
disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 19, 2024 and amended on 
March 8, 2024, beginning in late November 2023, a nation-state associated threat actor used a password spray attack 
to compromise a legacy test account and, in turn, gain access to Microsoft email accounts. The threat actor used 
information it obtained to gain unauthorized access to some of our source code repositories and internal systems, and 
the threat actor could continue to utilize this and other information to attempt to gain access to our systems or 
otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. This incident has and may continue to result in harm 
to our reputation and customer relationships. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can sustain malicious activities 
for extended periods and deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our 
customers, or our partners have and may continue to intensify due to our transparency to our customers, other 
stakeholders, and the public about cyberattacks, and during elections or periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict. 
Challenges or failures to update or apply security patches to all hardware and devices connected to our systems, 
including end-of-life and end-of-support equipment, have and may continue to result in unauthorized access to our 
systems and data in the future. Cyber incidents and attacks, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our 
financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, and reputation, or expose us to legal or regulatory risk.
Inadequate account security or organizational security practices, including those of companies we have acquired or 
those of the third parties we utilize, have resulted and may result in unauthorized access to our systems and data, 
including customer systems and data. For example, passwords may not be rotated and employee access may not be 
updated or removed on a timely basis. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ 
security or systems or reveal confidential information, and laws in foreign jurisdictions may compel actions by such 
parties against our interests and could limit our recourse. Malicious actors may employ the supply chain to introduce 
malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.

PART II
Item 1A
 
51
Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of 
detecting and successfully defending against them. Threat actors may also utilize emerging technologies, such as AI 
and machine learning. Our current capabilities may not detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may 
allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. It may be difficult to determine the best way to 
investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate the harm caused by a cyber incident. Such efforts may not be successful, 
and we may make errors or fail to take necessary actions. It is possible that threat actors may gain undetected access 
to other networks and systems after establishing a foothold on an internal system. Cyber incidents and attacks can 
have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems, as well as those 
of our partners and customers. In addition, it may take considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full 
impact of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to 
provide prompt, full, and reliable information about the incident to our customers, partners, regulators, and the public. 
Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security can disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, 
impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product 
development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information, result in theft or misuse of our 
intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to 
improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, 
actions taken to remediate an incident could result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our services.
Our internal environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We 
embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such 
as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal 
or third-party systems may create new attack surfaces or methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal 
security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge or the emerging cybersecurity 
regulations in jurisdictions worldwide.
Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data
The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or 
services across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us, 
whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to or attacks on our own 
infrastructure, such as the nation-state attack described in the prior risk factor, have also affected our customers and 
may do so in the future. The reliability of our cloud-based services and the protection of customer data depend on the 
security of our infrastructure, which includes hardware, software, and other elements provided by third parties. 
Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many 
of ours, as well as customers with sensitive data, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack 
our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero-day”) 
vulnerabilities. Product vulnerabilities can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not 
installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional 
malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud 
services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that 
information to compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as 
passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result 
in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services. Weaknesses in our 
development processes can result in vulnerabilities in our products. Open-source software can also contain 
vulnerabilities that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks as we increasingly incorporate open-source 
software into our products. Additionally, features that rely on generative AI can be susceptible to security threats.

PART II
Item 1A
 
Our customers operate complex systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may 
include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and 
products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, 
we may not be able to discontinue support of our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a 
more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase 
our customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied sizes and technical sophistication use our 
technology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state-
of-the-art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical 
sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these 
settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of operations and some customers may have limited capability to 
review and reset these defaults.
Cyberattacks could adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We 
are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have 
actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and 
support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks 
for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-
premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing 
environments.
Any of the foregoing events could result in reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs, or otherwise adversely 
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Development and deployment of defensive measures
To defend against security threats to our internal infrastructure, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, 
we must take a complex and multifaceted approach. This includes continuously engineering more secure products and 
services, and enhancing security, threat detection, and reliability features. We must also escalate and improve our 
development processes and the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products 
as well as those provided by others in a timely manner. In addition, we must develop mitigation technologies that help 
to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, and maintain the digital security 
infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services. Further, we must provide security tools 
such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security 
measures and the impact of doing so.
The cost of these measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If 
we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our processes, products, and services, data 
corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to exercise contractual or 
other remedies against us, reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use 
competing products or services. Customers and third parties granted access to customer systems may fail to update 
their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, may fail to timely install or enable 
security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Customers may also spend more on 
protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. 
Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government have enhanced or specialized 
expectations and requirements to which we must develop and engineer our products and services. Any of these could 
adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against 
us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no 
assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter 
into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.
Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem 
of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting 
it, we could experience adverse impacts to our results of operations, reputation, or competitive position.

52

PART II
Item 1A
 
Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow 
the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of 
personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence 
of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security 
controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our 
training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper 
disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. Relatedly, despite our efforts to 
continuously improve security controls, it is possible that we may fail to identify or mitigate insider threat activities that 
could lead to the misuse of our systems or customer and user data. In addition, third parties who have limited access to 
our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our 
reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, 
resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and 
users to store and process personal data on-premises or in a cloud-based environment we host. Government 
authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. 
and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government 
authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, 
use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services 
and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional 
security measures we take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where 
and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may 
increase costs or hinder sales of our products and services.
We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other 
Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or 
technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use 
of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from 
scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit 
which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.
Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses
For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third 
parties, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This 
activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, including through the use of AI 
technologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of 
our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or 
illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and 
technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and 
results of operations.
Other digital safety abuses
Our consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to find, generate, store, or disseminate harmful 
or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, 
the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such 
content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives have 
been enacted to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online. At the same time, 
regulations and other initiatives regarding freedom of expression may conflict with such content moderation regulations. 
Further, duties to address risks to children are driving new obligations for age verification and parental controls across 
the online ecosystem, including within app stores and operating systems. The legal and regulatory environment in this 
area is complex and continues to evolve across multiple jurisdictions. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty 
regarding both current and future compliance obligations. Failure to comply with content requirements may subject us 
to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage, which could adversely affect our 

53
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our products and services, how they are used by customers, and how third-party products and services 
interact with them, may present security, privacy, and execution risks. Our products and services may contain 
defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. For 
example, customers control our products and services, including our AI products, within their environments, and may 
deploy them in high-risk scenarios or utilize them inappropriately. Our products may also collect large amounts of data 
in manners which may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. Our customers also operate complex systems 
with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors whose products or personnel may take or fail to take 
actions which impact the reliability or security of our products and services. If our products and services do not work as 
intended, are utilized in methods not intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to 
legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation, or 
adversely affect our results of operations.
Issues in the development, deployment, and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or 
liability. We are building AI into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI 
available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, 
including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in 
which AI operating in devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and 
personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore 
our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or 
contain biased or inaccurate information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, inaccurate, or 
otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could 
result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions, cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result 
in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain inputs and outputs or other forms of 
human oversight may be required, including for agentic AI systems that can take actions autonomously. Companion or 
highly-personalized AI systems may result in over-reliance or dependence by users that is harmful. Our implementation 
of AI systems could result in legal liability, regulatory action, litigation, brand, reputational, or competitive harm, or other 
adverse impacts. These risks may stem from issues related to AI model and system capabilities, intellectual property, 
data privacy, product liability, and other claims associated with AI training, outputs, and system behavior. They are 
further compounded by the evolving regulatory landscape, with new laws emerging globally and increased scrutiny 
from regulators and lawmakers. Certain AI technologies and use cases present ethical issues or may have broad or 
uneven impacts on society or vulnerable groups within society. There is also rising divergence globally in how to 
address these issues and impacts, with the result that we will need to navigate a web of different tensions across 
geographies. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization 
by our customers and partners, are contrary to our responsible AI policies and practices, or are otherwise controversial 
because of the impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, our 
reputation, competitive position, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

PART II
Item 1A
 
OPERATIONAL RISKS
We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an 
adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our 
products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease 
datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our 
websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, 
predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units and other components. The 
cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to 
a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands 
continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of 
existing services, including through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our 
business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. 
Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of 
principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an 
Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and 
regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. We also face community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local 
dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary 
or permanent loss of customer data, outages, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power or 
water supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity could diminish the quality of our products, services, and 
user experience, resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, 
damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which could 
adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
We may experience supply or quality problems. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter 
components. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our 
server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. 
Capacity available to us may be affected as competitors use some of the same suppliers and materials for hardware 
components. If components are delayed or become unavailable or more expensive, whether because of supplier 
capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we 
may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales, higher costs, or inadequate datacenter capacity 
to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or 
obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Datacenter 
servers, Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may 
be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages which could adversely affect our business, 
operations, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Our software products and services also have and may in the future experience quality or reliability problems. The 
processes we use to develop our software are imperfect. Like all software, our software contains bugs and other 
defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions 
and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent on one another. Our products and 
services may be impacted by interaction with third-party products and services. Our customers may also utilize their 
own or third-party products and services whose reliability is dependent on interaction with our products and services. 
Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Weaknesses in our 
processes could result in defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing, which could cause reduced sales, 
damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal 
liability, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although our license 
agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these 
provisions will withstand legal challenge.
Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly 
complex. Failure to prevent, detect, or address defects in design, manufacture, or associated software could result in 
recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

PART II
Item 1A
 
56
LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS
We are subject to a variety of new, existing, and evolving legal and regulatory requirements that could 
adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal 
requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and 
those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, digital 
accessibility, advertising, and online safety. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the 
European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated services. This 
trend may continue with our offerings becoming subject to additional data protection, security, digital safety, law 
enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, 
and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws 
that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. In addition, laws requiring us to retrieve and produce 
customer data in response to compulsory legal demands from law enforcement and governmental authorities are 
expanding and the requests we are experiencing are increasing in volume and complexity.
New, existing, and evolving laws and regulations, or interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a 
manner inconsistent with our interpretations of such laws and regulations or our practices, may result in modification of 
our products and services, altered business models and operations, increased costs, reputational damage, and civil or 
criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding: 
•
Competition laws and new market regulation: Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and 
foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and enacting 
new regulations to intervene in digital markets, and this includes markets such as the EU, the United 
Kingdom, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of 
anti-competitive conduct. U.S. and foreign antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions 
and continue to scrutinize our business. Competition law enforcement actions and court decisions along with 
new market regulations may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to 
consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from 
them. New competition law actions or obligations under market regulation schemes could be initiated, 
potentially using previous actions as precedent.
•
AI: Legislative and regulatory action is evolving with respect to AI, which could increase costs or restrict 
opportunity. For example, the EU’s AI Act may increase costs or impact the provision or operation of our AI 
models and services in the European market. AI regulatory areas include model and system development 
and deployment, frontier model safety, transparency, content provenance, digital replicas, and AI 
companions. 
•
Anti-corruption: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations 
(“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the 
accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal 
controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be 
based on reports from employees and others about our business activities and our compliance with Anti-
Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them and also cooperate with 
investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities.

PART II
Item 1A
 
•
Trade: Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our 
operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, 
and other countries could prohibit business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict 
Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in 
specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication 
technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and 
communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain regulations 
may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Restrictions on data flows and 
outbound investment and customer sensitivities may limit our ability to leverage parts of our global 
engineering footprint to provide services in certain jurisdictions. Increased geopolitical instabilities and 
changing U.S. Administration priorities create an unpredictable trade landscape. U.S. tariff, shifting AI export 
controls policies, and disagreements among governments on sanctions policies toward third countries, could 
increase operational costs, create uncertainty in the continuity of our products, and accelerate sovereignty 
initiatives among international partners and customers. The volatility of U.S. tariffs has triggered economic 
uncertainty and could impact cloud and devices supply chain cost competitiveness. The potential 
replacement of the recently rescinded AI Diffusion Rule, expanded export license conditions, and other 
potential AI-related rulemakings could adversely affect Microsoft’s business, strategy, and operations. 
Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict like the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas 
conflict could continue to result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may 
impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade 
ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us.
•
Cybersecurity: Legislative and regulatory actions related to cybersecurity may increase the costs 
associated with developing, implementing, or securing our products and services. The legal and regulatory 
environment in this area is complex and continues to evolve across multiple jurisdictions. As a result, there 
is considerable uncertainty regarding both current and future compliance obligations. This uncertainty 
increases the risk that we may incur additional operational costs, face regulatory enforcement actions, or 
encounter challenges in the development and deployment of our products.
•
Handling of personal data: Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of 
personal data globally continue to evolve. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services 
internationally relies on the movement of data across national boundaries. Data protection authorities and 
governments in the EU and other markets have and may again restrict and/or block the use of services that 
involve the transfer of data across borders. New and evolving rules and restrictions on the flow of data 
across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services. In addition, 
the EU General Data Protection Regulation and other similar regulations impose a range of compliance 
obligations regarding the handling of personal data. New requirements related to the use of data, including 
the Data Act, add additional rules and restrictions on the use of data in our products and services.
•
Environmental, Social, and Governance: Laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental, social, 
and governance matters are being developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which 
may include greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage caps, as well as specific, target-driven 
environmental, social, and governance frameworks and disclosure requirements. In addition, in 2020 we 
announced goals to become carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030. AI development and 
deployment has and may continue to raise energy use and emissions, making it harder to meet these goals. 
Any failure or perceived failure to meet our sustainability goals, or to meet various sustainability regulatory 
requirements, could result in claims and lawsuits, regulatory actions, penalties, or damage to our reputation, 
each of which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
How these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change, and sometimes may be 
inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments’ approach to enforcement, and our products and 
services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve 
significant costs and operational efforts, or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely 
affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties, criminal sanctions, or orders 
to cease the alleged noncompliant activity. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, 
we could face regulatory or legal actions, and our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations 
could be adversely affected.

57

PART II
Item 1A
 
We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of 
claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major 
new product releases, AI services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, 
and regulation. As we continue to expand our business and offerings, we may experience new and novel legal claims. 
Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that 
could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent 
uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. An adverse impact to our financial 
condition and results of operations could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes 
probable and reasonably estimable.
Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue 
from government contracts. Government contracts and regulatory requirements can present risks and challenges not 
present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we are subject to government audits and investigations 
relating to these contracts, and we are required to provide assurance and attestations about our products and 
processes. If we do not satisfy contractual or regulatory requirements, we could be suspended or debarred as a 
governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances 
contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for 
higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, 
cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These 
events could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.
We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. 
Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, 
there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may recognize 
additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws, regulations, and 
administrative practices and principles, including changes to the global tax framework, in various jurisdictions. In recent 
years, multiple domestic and international tax proposals were proposed to impose greater tax burdens on large 
multinational enterprises. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to 
advance proposals or guidance in international taxation, including the establishment of a global minimum tax.
We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for 
income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. 
In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax 
disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under IRS audit for prior tax years and have received Notices of 
Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for the tax years 2004 to 2013. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate 
to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus 
penalties and interest. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments, and other audits or litigation, may differ from 
the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and adversely affect our results of operations in the 
period or periods in which that determination is made.
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in 
countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about 
certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, 
changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other global 
fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing 
jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions could adversely affect our financial 
condition and results of operations.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS
We face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our 
business and operating results being harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed 
copying and use of our software, source code, and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the 
absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. 

58

PART II
Item 1A
 
Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology. Our increasing 
engagement with open-source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain 
situations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our 
business. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become 
easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our results of 
operations. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code or other intellectual property also increases the 
security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.
Third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their 
intellectual property rights, including current copyright infringement and other claims arising from AI training and output. 
To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty-bearing data access or licensing agreements on terms that are less 
favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy 
indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or 
injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing 
technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual 
property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue 
to do so, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
GENERAL RISKS
If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and results of operations may be harmed. Our 
reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our 
ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation 
or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and 
sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, 
government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering 
decisions, public policy positions, or corporate philanthropic initiatives. Damage to our reputation or our brands may 
occur from, among other things:
•
The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners 
do not like.
•
Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, content, or development and 
deployment of AI.
•
Data security breaches, cybersecurity incidents, responsible AI failures, compliance failures, or actions of 
partners or individual employees.
Social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation 
are damaged, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or ability to attract the most highly qualified 
employees.
Adverse economic or market conditions could harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including 
inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely 
affect our results of operations. If demand for computing power, PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, 
or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our 
software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such 
as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.
Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they 
have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.

59

PART II
Item 1A
 
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to 
general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that 
affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If 
global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to 
an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio could be adversely affected and we could 
determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that 
could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems, 
operations, or supply chain because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or 
other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical 
functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain 
other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the 
Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the 
destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as 
power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations or adversely affect our results of operations. 
Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems 
and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential negative consequences of 
prolonged service outages.
Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose economic 
and other risks, which may negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers, increase our operating 
costs, or otherwise disrupt our operations in markets both directly and indirectly impacted by such events. These 
conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers 
and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing 
regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to 
national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact 
our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes could 
adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in geopolitical conditions also increase the security risks described 
elsewhere in these risk factors.
The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, could adversely affect our business, 
operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business 
going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and 
individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of 
recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in 
these Risk Factors.
The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. 
Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may 
affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. 
Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to 
develop software and provide cloud-based services.
Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers, employees, and infrastructure 
are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature 
of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Global, regional, and local economic 
developments, monetary policy, geopolitical tension, particularly between the U.S. and Europe, restrictions on 
international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports, inflation, and recession, as well as political 
and military disputes, could adversely affect our results of operations. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as 
general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenue, 
increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions, which could adversely affect our business, financial 
condition, and results of operations.

PART II
Item 1A
 
61
In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several 
risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in 
staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human 
rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial 
environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism 
may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, disagreements among 
governments on export controls and sanctions toward third countries, investment restrictions, or other developments 
that make it more difficult to operate and sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed 
or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair our ability to operate in 
certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, 
significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect 
our results of operations.
Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on 
successfully attracting, training, and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and 
skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our 
brand and reputation, as well as an inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important 
to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive 
domestic immigration laws. Restraints on the flow of technical and professional talent, including those derived from 
changes to U.S. immigration policies or laws, may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development 
efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, 
our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services could be adversely affected. Effective succession 
planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth 
transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws 
are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how 
we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some
