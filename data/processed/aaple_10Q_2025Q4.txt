Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
Note 1 – Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively
“Apple” or the “Company”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements reﬂect
all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair ﬁnancial statement presentation. The preparation of
these condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of management estimates. These condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements and
accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated ﬁnancial statements and accompanying
notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the ﬁscal year ended September 27, 2025 (the “2025 Form 10-K”).
The Company’s ﬁscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included
in the ﬁrst ﬁscal quarter every ﬁve or six years to realign the Company’s ﬁscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s ﬁscal
years 2026 and 2025 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods
refer to the Company’s ﬁscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those ﬁscal years.
Note 2 – Revenue
The following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for the three
months ended December 27, 2025 and December 28, 2024 (in millions):

The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in
Note 10, “Segment Information” for the three months ended December 27, 2025 and December 28, 2024, except in Greater China,
where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.
As of December 27, 2025 and September 27, 2025, the Company had total deferred revenue of $14.3 billion and $13.7 billion,
respectively. As of December 27, 2025, the Company expects 66% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 23%
within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.

The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 ﬁnancial instruments, which generally have
counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using signiﬁcant inputs
derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
As of December 27, 2025, 78% of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-backed
securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 17% between 5 and 10 years, and 5% greater than 10 years. As of December 27,
2025, 12% of the Company’s non-current mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 18%
between 5 and 10 years, and 70% greater than 10 years.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or
the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion
of the ﬁnancial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
To protect gross margins from ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments,
and may designate these instruments as cash ﬂow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign
currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange
rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as
either cash ﬂow or fair value hedges. As of December 27, 2025, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash ﬂows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 17 years.
The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from
certain ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the
remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from ﬂuctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate
swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash ﬂow or fair value hedges.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements
provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to
any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic
conditions and tariffs and other measures on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements can also be identiﬁed by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,”
“intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees
of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ signiﬁcantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking
statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2025
Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no
obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s ﬁscal calendar, and references to particular
years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s ﬁscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and
periods of those ﬁscal years.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2025 Form 10-K ﬁled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) and the condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q.
Available Information
The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor
relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about ﬁnancial performance, information
on corporate governance, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the
websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this ﬁling. Further, the Company’s references to website
URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its ﬁrst quarter compared to other quarters in its ﬁscal year due in part
to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can signiﬁcantly impact net sales, cost of sales and
operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels
as these channels are ﬁlled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines
as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product
introduction.
During the ﬁrst quarter of 2026, the Company announced the following updated products:
•
14-inch MacBook Pro
•
iPad Pro
•
Apple Vision Pro
Macroeconomic Conditions
Macroeconomic conditions, including inﬂation, interest rates, component pricing and currency ﬂuctuations, have directly and
indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.

Tariffs and Other Measures
Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S., including additional tariffs on imports
from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European Union (“EU”), among others. In response, several
countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. On
January 14, 2026, initial results were published of the previously announced U.S. Department of Commerce investigation under
Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing
equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. The announcement of the
initial results of the investigation did not impose any additional tariffs affecting the Company’s products at this time. Various
modiﬁcations to U.S. tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional
measures under the Section 232 semiconductor sector investigation, additional sector-based tariffs, or other measures. Tariffs and
other measures that are applied to the Company’s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition, including impacting the Company’s supply chain, the availability
of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will
depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to
what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of
these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and
result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company’s products and services, all
of which can further adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the ﬁrst quarter of 2026 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to a
lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax beneﬁts from share-based
compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the ﬁrst quarter of 2026 was higher compared to the ﬁrst quarter of 2025 primarily due to the
impact of foreign currency loss regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2024 and the tax impact
from foreign currency revaluations in the ﬁrst quarter of 2025 related to the State Aid Decision.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing
operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufﬁcient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over
the next 12 months and beyond.
The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2025 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing
purchase obligations and other purchase obligations.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform ﬁnal
assembly and testing of ﬁnished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of
individual suppliers. As of December 27, 2025, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $44.4 billion, with $43.7
billion payable within 12 months.
Other Purchase Obligations
The Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed
intellectual property and content, distribution rights, and the acquisition of capital assets related to product manufacturing. As of
December 27, 2025, the Company had other purchase obligations of $35.1 billion, with $9.3 billion payable within 12 months.
Capital Return Program
In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not
obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of December 27, 2025, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend
was $0.26 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of
Directors.
During the ﬁrst quarter of 2026, the Company repurchased $25.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend
equivalents of $3.9 billion.

2023-09”), which will require the Company to disclose speciﬁed additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and
provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to
disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for signiﬁcant
individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and the Company’s discussion and analysis
of its ﬁnancial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates
that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of
the 2025 Form 10-K describe the signiﬁcant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the
2025 Form 10-K.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the ﬁrst three months of 2026. For a discussion of the
Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2025 Form 10-K.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal
executive ofﬁcer and principal ﬁnancial ofﬁcer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as deﬁned in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of December 27, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it ﬁles or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods speciﬁed in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and
communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive ofﬁcer and principal ﬁnancial ofﬁcer, as appropriate

to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting during the ﬁrst quarter of 2026, which were
identiﬁed in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Digital Markets Act Investigations
On March 25, 2024, the European Commission (“Commission”) announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation
against the Company under Article 5(4) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) (“Article 5(4) Investigation”). The Article 5(4)
Investigation relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App
Store, as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced that
it had opened an additional formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual
requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA (“Article 6(4) Investigation”). On April 23,
2025, the Commission ﬁned the Company €500 million in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring
the Company to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution
channels outside the App Store. The Company has appealed the Commission’s Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23, 2025, the
Commission issued preliminary ﬁndings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a ﬁnal determination in the Article
6(4) Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose ﬁnes up to 10% of the
Company’s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional ﬁnes if it deems that the Company has
violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its
compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.
Department of Justice Lawsuit
On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general ﬁled a civil antitrust
lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted
monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is
seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been ﬁled in
state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other
nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.
Epic Games
Epic Games, Inc. ﬁled a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (“California District Court”) against the
Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s
operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Review Guidelines
violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction (the “2021 Injunction”) enjoining the Company from prohibiting
developers from including in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing
mechanisms other than the Company’s in-app purchase system. On April 30, 2025, the California District Court found the Company
to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the Company from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that
consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases
outside an app; or otherwise interfering with a consumer’s choice to proceed in or out of an app (the “2025 Injunction”). The
Company appealed the California District Court’s April 2025 decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit
Court”). On December 11, 2025, the Ninth Circuit Court issued an order upholding the 2025 Injunction in part and modifying certain
aspects to allow the Company to require parity in size, form and placement between the Company’s in-app purchase and any links
for consumers to make purchases outside an app. The Ninth Circuit Court also held that the Company can charge a commission on
link-out purchases, and remanded to the California District Court to further amend or modify the 2025 Injunction, consistent with the
Ninth Circuit Court’s order. The deadline for the Company to ﬁle a petition for rehearing is March 2, 2026.

Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the ﬁrst quarter of 2026 that did not individually or in the aggregate
have a material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If
one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations,
the Company’s ﬁnancial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, ﬁnancial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely
affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2025 Form
10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2025 Form 10-
K.
