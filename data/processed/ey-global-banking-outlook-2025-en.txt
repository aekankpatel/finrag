Global banking outlook 2025

If one theme represented 2024, it was uncertainty. 
Geopolitical uncertainty, as more than half the world’s 
population went to the polls; regulatory uncertainty, 
driven by fragmentation, exemplified by late 
adaptations to Basel finalization in the US; economic 
uncertainty, as central banks made progress in 
fighting inflation, but GDP growth has remained 
subdued; technological uncertainty as institutions 
grapple with making the right investments in emerging 
technology. Despite this, banks have proven their 
resilience with strong results supported by a keen focus 
on profitability and consistently low loan losses. 
We expect uncertainty to be the watchword of 2025 
too, but we expect industry leaders to have the 
capacity to be able to navigate it successfully, with 
sector profitability (returns on equity) likely to remain 
in the double digits. 
For a sector already balancing numerous competing 
priorities, sustaining profitability will be critical to 
unlocking the capacity it needs to invest in strategic 
decisions around geographic footprint, technology, 
customers, staff, and societal purpose that will support 
future growth. 
Shifting drivers of income
Average global banking returns on equity (ROE) in 2024 
are expected to be slightly shy of 12%. This is about one 
percentage point below the 2023 outturn (the post- 
financial crisis peak). Nevertheless, it is a better 
outcome than many might have expected at the start of 
this year, given both anticipated interest rate pathways 
and expectations around asset quality. 
Looking to 2025, we expect profitability to remain flat, 
but the drivers of banking profitability will be different 
and further gains will increasingly depend on banks’ 
ability to transform their business models.

From margin expansion to loan growth
As we head into 2025, market forecasts are for central 
banks to reduce interest rates by around 70bps over 
the course of the year. However, there remains intense 
debate about the pace of the declines, where interest 
rates will eventually settle, and the shape of the yield 
curve. 
In anticipation of margin pressures, banks have 
strategically increased the proportion of assets that 
lock in the current high interest rates for several years. 
In markets such as the UK, these bond portfolios 
account for up to a third of banks’ net interest income, 
a share that is likely to increase. Despite these actions, 
margin gains will become a less important driver. 
Instead, loan growth is expected to pick up as declining 
interest rates stimulate loan demand, previously 
suppressed by rising rates. Globally, current forecasts 
are for loan growth of 6% in 2025 (vs. 2% in 2024), 
which will allow net interest income to resume growth 
in 2025 (3% vs. no growth in 2024). In Europe, where 
economic growth overall is expected to remain muted, 
the EY European Bank Lending Economic Forecast 
forecasts bank loan growth across Germany, France, 
Spain and Italy of 3.1% in 2025, up from 0.2% this year. 
Growth is expected to pick up consistently across 
mortgages, consumer credit and business lending.
Loan losses will remain manageable 
A persistent source of surprise to quarterly earnings 
over the last couple of years has been the low levels of 
loan losses. Slowing economic growth and pressures on 
consumers’ disposable incomes have not translated into 
distress in banks’ loan books. We expect this pattern to 
continue through 2025. 
Loan impairment rates were 50bps in 2024, below the 
long-term average of 64bps between 2010 and 2019. 
These benign trends reflect the structural change in the 
regulatory regime imposed following the 2007-08 global 
financial crisis and the related improvements in banks’ 
risk management. 
Even in the most affected sectors, such as commercial 
real estate which has seen a material drop in demand 
as work and shopping behaviours have changed, losses 
have remained manageable. Banks have been proactive 
in identifying and resolving any deterioration in credit 
quality. 
Falling rates will offer further relief to borrowers and we 
expect loan impairment rates in 2025 to remain near 
their current levels. 
Continued recovery in fee income
EY analysis shows investment banking fees saw a strong 
rebound in 2024, growing by 11% and reversing the 
decline of 5% seen in 2023. More clarity over the 
direction of interest rates drove equity market 
trading revenues and deal-making activity, which 
reached a two-year high in the second quarter of 2024, 
while third quarter revenues were at their highest in 15 
years. Based on EY forecasts, these trends are expected 
to continue, and investment banking revenues to grow 
by 13% in 2025, led by a strong recovery in merger and 
acquisitions and debt and equity issuance.

Wealth management fees also witnessed a recovery 
this year. Banks saw strong inflows as they channelled 
deposits into asset management products and 
benefited from a rise in stock markets which lifted their 
asset bases. We expect falling rates will continue to 
provide a tailwind to these dynamics, prompting clients 
to shift their deposits into investment products. 
Payments also represents an opportunity for banks, 
driven by the rapid digitization of business-to-business 
payments and cross-border transactions, as well as 
innovations in the consumer payments space with 
real-time account-to-action payments, and a rise in 
e-commerce activities. Global payments revenues 
currently seeing a cumulative annual growth rate of 
around 9.5%.

Looking ahead, improved stability will allow 
leadership teams to focus on addressing wider 
structural opportunities and risks. We have outlined 
five of these below, and the key questions banks will 
therefore need to address: 
 
Managing geopolitical risk: As the year of 
elections ends, how can banks support clients in 
a fragmented global political landscape? 
 
Unlocking value from technology investment: 
How can banks maximize the value delivered 
from innovation budgets as the balance of spend 
shifts to mandatory change initiatives? 
 
Adapting to changed customer and colleague 
expectations: As behaviours have changed, 
have banks changed sufficiently in response? 
 
Redefining purpose: How do banks ensure they 
play a positive role in society, including shaping 
the transition to a low-carbon world and 
championing positive social action? 
 
Finding a path to sustainable profitability: 
Cost transformation is en vogue, but can banks 
also find new paths for growth that will deliver 
higher returns more easily?
We expand on each of these priorities below.
Part 2: 
Five priorities for banks
Managing geopolitical risk 
The end of the “year of democracy”, when more than 
four billion people went to the polls, could have 
alleviated the geopolitical concerns that have been at 
the top of bank boards’ agendas in the past year. 
However, the clarity of election results has been 
complicated by the prospect of diverging and 
protectionist policies, further fragmenting the 
regulatory landscape for international banks.
Banks now confront complex and costly challenges in 
ensuring compliance that extends beyond traditional risk 
management to emerging domains like artificial 
intelligence (AI) and data privacy. They also face 
challenging business and operational decisions around 
location strategies. Increased focus on operational 
resiliency means banks need to factor in not just the 
political operating environment, but also international 
talent pools, infrastructure, and the use data across 
their organization. Banks are proactively developing 
scenario planning capabilities to assess potential risks 
and opportunities, including through divestments or 
acquisitions. 
The geopolitical complexity is most pronounced in the 
real economy, where global supply chains are 
simultaneously transforming. This volatile environment 
presents a strategic opportunity for banks to 
differentiate themselves as expert risk management 
partners to their clients, transforming geopolitical 
uncertainty into a competitive advantage. 
Containing costs, enabling growth 
Over the last couple of years, banks have faced pressures 
on their cost bases due to inflation. This impact was felt 
most acutely in 2023, as operating expenses rose by 6%. 
Banks reacted and balanced these inflationary pressures 
with efficiency measures, containing cost growth to a 
modest 1% in 2024. 
While inflation rates have now largely been brought under 
control, other challenges will take center stage. In 2024, 
regulatory mandates forced banks to divert technology 
budgets toward “run the business” spend, coming at the 
expense of transformational “change the business” 
investments — a pattern likely to continue into 2025.
While mandatory spend to strengthen operational 
resilience will remain elevated in 2025, banks will also 
face a growing urgency to work through the backlog of 
“change the business” projects. As these competing 
demands intensify, costs are expected to grow by around 
3% next year. The challenge for banks is how they contain, 
or reduce, costs in a way the enables transformation and 
growth rather than inhibits it. 
Stability as a platform for future growth 
Global banking returns on equity are estimated to reach 
11.7% in 2024, well above the historical average of 9.4% 
between 2010 and 2019. Looking ahead to 2025, we 
expect profitability overall to remain stable although the 
underlying dynamics driving profitability will shift 
significantly. This is a clear opportunity for banks to be 
more forward looking. Delivering another year of stable 
profitability, especially without the recent interest rate 
tailwinds, will allow banks to demonstrate real value to 
the market. It will open the door to greater transactions 
activity within the sector, especially as banks seek greater 
domestic scale, or rationalize their international 
footprints. It will also allow banking leaders to spend 
more time focusing on addressing the strategic risks and 
opportunities the new year will bring.

Unlocking value from technology investment 
Stafford Beer, an early management scientist, said, 
“The way in which computers were used in the 1970s 
was as if companies had recruited the greatest 
geniuses of humanity, before setting them to work 
memorizing the phone book to save a few seconds 
turning pages.”1 
In 2025, global banks are expected to spend US$176b 
on IT, up from US$167b in 2024 and US$147b in 
2022. However, only 39% of this is expected to be 
allocated to change-the-business initiatives such as 
customer service improvements and new product 
development. This reverses the trend of recent years 
where the balance of run-the-business and change-the-
business spend had moved toward greater parity. 
With so much money on the line, how do banks make 
sure they aren’t just “memorizing the phone book” 
and demonstrate tangible return on investments? One 
explicit area of focus for banks to achieve this will be 
getting their data AI-ready, in anticipation of 
accelerated AI deployment in 2026 and beyond. 
Without understanding what data is needed, ensuring it 
is clean and standardized, appropriately structured and 
secure, it will be near impossible for banks to unlock 
the full value of AI in their organization.

The broader challenge banks face in releasing value from 
technology investment lies in multiple interconnected 
factors: rigid budgeting cycles; business cases that focus 
on self-funding and short pay-back periods; a lack of 
accountability between business units and tech teams; 
misaligned IT and business strategies; and difficulties in 
justifying multiyear transformation projects. Most 
critically, banks often fail to consider both hard data and 
soft signals (for example, qualitative customer and 
colleague feedback) when assessing return on 
investment (ROI).

Unlocking the value from these investments offers 
compelling rewards. Cloud adoption highlights this. 
Using cloud for storage and computing may save costs, 
but leveraging cloud with AI for advanced data 
analytics can allow banks to offer personalization at 
scale, amplifying the overall ROI. 
To succeed, banks must fundamentally transform their 
approach to technology investment and implementation. 
This means cultivating a culture of continuous learning, 
prioritizing the value of new technologies over their 
costs, actively capturing client and colleague feedback, 
and reimagining work processes during technological 
implementation. 
Adapting to changed customer and colleague 
expectations 
Customer behaviours have fundamentally changed with 
the digital revolution. Both retail and corporate banking 
customers now expect seamless, round-the-clock service 
across multiple channels and devices. Personalization is 
a key differentiator, accelerated by the shift from open 
banking to open finance. However, most banks struggle 
to deliver truly personalized offers due to their inability 
to generate and understand detailed customer journey 
data. Many continue to invest significant resources in 
resolving data quality issues rather than generating 
actionable, monetizable customer insights. 
Colleague expectations have evolved equally. The 2024 
EY Work Reimagined Survey reveals that 65% of 
employees prefer working from home three to five days 
a week, with millennials and Gen Z driving this demand. 
This is backed up by talent health (a measure of em-
ployee likelihood to recommend their employer) being 
significantly lower in organizations mandating full office 
returns. The challenge for banks is how they set and 
maintain a corporate culture when, even where staff 
are in the office, less than one-third say they have an 
assigned desk. 
Banks need to maximize culture for onsite workers and 
space for knowledge-worker collaboration while 
addressing compliance risks of working from anywhere. 
The positive news for financial firms is they have 
clearly made decent progress adapting to a new cohort 
of workers, with reported talent health the most positive 
for millennials, followed by Gen Z, with Gen X and baby 
boomers lagging.

Redefining purpose 
There have been suggestions of slowing environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) momentum, and there is 
an increasing probability that many banks will reassess 
their interim net-zero targets due to inconsistent global 
climate policy. Data — what ESG data you should 
capture and report, how you capture it and the 
transparency of it — continues to be a challenge. 
That said, the urgent need to address climate change 
presents a significant opportunity for banks. The 
International Energy Agency estimates that while 
US$1.8t was invested in clean energy in 2023, US$4.5t 
needs to be invested annually until 2030 to limit global 
warming to 1.5°C. Many banks have already made 
significant commitments to the transition; the 10 largest 
banks in the Americas and Europe have committed 
US$8.2t and US$3.0t respectively. EY analysis also 
shows that global sustainability-linked loans saw 36% 
growth from 2021 to 2023.
Further, the EY Sustainable Finance Index reveals a 
steady rise in environmental scores across 800 banks 
globally, reflecting cumulative efforts to address climate 
change. While the pace of improvement has slowed and 
some measures like emission intensity (GHG emissions 
in tonnes per dollar of assets) appear to be going in the 
wrong direction, this is likely due to increased scrutiny 
and improved reporting standards rather than reduced 
commitment. 
The Sustainable Finance Index ‘Social and Governance’ 
parameters also show the industry is making steady 
progress on diversity. The latest data shows broad 
gender balance between staff. There is more to do at 
senior management and board level, where women make 
up 37% and 25% of those cohorts respectively, but there 
has been steady improvement over recent years that 
we expect to continue in the year ahead. We also expect 
banks to continue to build diversity in skills both at board 
and senior management level. The data from EY’s 
European Boardroom Monitor demonstrates how 
seriously banks are trying to address challenging issues 
around technology, sustainability geopolitics but 
recruiting expertise at board level. This should be seen 
as banks reaffirming their purpose in society and be 
reassuring to staff and customers alike. 
Finding a path to sustainable profitability
Sluggish growth is pushing banks toward cost 
transformation, but the challenge is daunting. EY 
estimates suggest a single percentage point increase 
in return on equity (ROE) requires a 6% reduction in the 
sector's cost base – a seemingly unrealistic goal for an 
industry that has seen continuous cost increases since 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 
If banks were to achieve a percentage point 
improvement in ROE through growth alone, they would 
need to grow just 3%. Are there opportunities for 
growth? In part 1, we highlighted multiple growth 
opportunities: Investment banking shows promise, and 
wealth management continues to attract investment. 
Similarly, the global embedded finance market is 
estimated to reach US$606b in 2025, more than double 
its 2021 size. Inorganic growth avenues also present 
themselves. Although banks in Europe would like to see 
substantially more progress on the banking and capital 
markets union, before embarking on cross-border 
mergers.
The critical insight is that neither cost reduction nor 
growth alone will guarantee sustainable returns. Banks 
must find a balanced approach that simultaneously 
controls costs and drives expansion, requiring a 
fundamental reimagining of their business models and 
growth strategies. 
Can banks seize the opportunity? 
As ever, banking leadership teams will be busy in 2025, 
managing a host of business-as-usual risks and adapting 
to a new geopolitical environment. But the early 
indicators are that the operating environment should be 
sufficiently benign to allow leadership teams to tackle 
some of the wider risks and opportunities. 
The key question is whether new approaches to tackling 
these issues can be found. Technology offers a wealth 
of opportunity to find solutions, but will banks be bold 
enough to completely re-engineer processes and ways of 
working end-to-end? 
We believe they will. The banking sector has proven its 
resilience time and again through recent volatility. As 
we look ahead, we see an exciting opportunity for banks 
to unlock the investment capacity that enables them 
to manage their existing priorities while seizing the to 
transform their businesses for future growth and be a 
force for good.
