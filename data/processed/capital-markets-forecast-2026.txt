Successful investing involves both art and science. The former is the “je ne sais quoi” 
that comes from an effective mixture of experience, intuition, and humility. You are 
lucky if you have it and, if you don’t, there is little you can do to acquire it anytime soon.
The science of investing, by contrast, is available to all through the careful study of 
events and their antecedents. Fortunately, history rhymes and through the thoughtful 
framing of key economic factors and study of their effects, we can gain a clearer sense 
of what economic trends may hold in the future.
Experimentation is normal
Periodically, there is a deviation from economic trends or policy changes so significant 
that it can be analogized only to economic experimentation. We find ourselves in such 
a time today—making history less relevant and calling on a deeper understanding of 
macro theory and current observations to predict where the economy and markets 
may be headed.
Critical to our inquiry is appreciating that experimentation is a feature—not a bug—of 
an evolving economy. Much like science itself, there cannot be progress without 
testing new combinations of elements and interactions among variables.
History is littered with examples. These notably include withdrawing the U.S. from the 
gold standard in 1971; creating the euro in 1999; founding the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) in 1995 and granting China’s membership in 2001; bailing out banks during the 
global financial crisis; and the Federal Reserve taking decisive action in times of crisis 
such as the pandemic that encompassed rock-bottom interest rates, balance-sheet 
expansion (i.e., quantitative easing), and the Fed’s role as lender of last resort.
Many economic experiments have elevated nations, moved financial markets forward, 
and even saved lives. But as with science, not all experiments yield anticipated—or 
even positive—results. Some offer no material advancement, while others can go very 
wrong. Often, the results are known only with the benefit of many years of careful 
observation.
While the paradigm of scientific experiment involves controlled tests and the isolation 
of one experimental variable at a time, the real world is not a laboratory. Economic 
experiments implicate the unpredictability of human behavior and play out in a 
dynamic arena of infinite variables. Isolating any single factor at a time is simply not 
possible. We must combine the science of observation with the art of interpretation to 
best estimate how today’s economic experiments will continue to unfold.
Themes for 2026
Our 2026 Capital Markets Forecast dives into some of the economic experiments 
occurring today, offers our insights and observations, and draws key connections 
to investment strategy. We place no normative judgment on the merits of the 
hypotheses being tested today, but rather strive to draw economic conclusions and 
identify investment opportunities—where we believe we have sufficient observational 
data points to do so.

Economic Experimentation

Our first theme takes on the experiment of tariffs at the highest rates in the post-
WWII period, intended to redirect global supply chains back to the U.S. for purposes of 
economic prosperity and national security. We analyze the tariff policy’s current and 
possible future impact on manufacturing activity, jobs, and budgetary revenue while 
highlighting some of the investment opportunities we see associated with the new 
trade regime.
The second theme looks at the shrinking of the labor force. Demographics, immigration 
policy, and corporate investment in artificial intelligence form a powerful concoction 
with potentially significant implications for long-term economic growth and tomorrow’s 
stock-market leaders.
Third, we tackle a familiar topic: the U.S. debt trajectory. This experiment has been 
years in the making and shows no signs of changing. Can the U.S. borrow far above 
current debt levels, as is projected, without unleashing disastrous consequences? 
How can investors attempt to hedge against such risks?
Finally, we pull these strands together with what we believe matters most to 
our clients: a discussion of how the experiments are informing our investment 
and diversification strategies to start the new year. And as it relates to portfolio 
construction, we recognize that the equity market’s current concentration in the 
shares of AI-related companies is an experiment in and of itself.
To reiterate, we believe that experimentation is not inherently negative, but that 
it takes us into unfamiliar territory, adding risk and, potentially, volatility to the 
investment landscape. It also can create a greater need for the art of investing, i.e., 
experience and inference to help anticipate which investments may prove to be 
successful diversifiers in the future.
The scientific method at work in portfolios
We begin 2026 recognizing that the results of some economic experiments will 
become clear in the year ahead, but many will take more time.
We expect the U.S. economy to recover from its fourth-quarter slowdown, but it 
could take the balance of the year before we see growth return to a 2% annualized 
trend. Consumers likely will continue to operate in a two-speed economy wherein 
high-income consumers continue to spend but low-income consumers face strain. 
Overall, we see the U.S. expansion continuing in 2026.
From our themes, we seek to identify compelling investment opportunities in areas 
such as industrial capital goods, technology, and private markets.1 However, a long 
investment horizon is necessary—and caution is warranted in the short term—as 
certain areas of the market are trading at frothy valuations.
Diversification against global fiscal risks may be partially achievable with 
opportunistic additions to precious metals and even cryptocurrency. 
The latter may not be appropriate for all investors, particularly the risk averse. 
Finally, a historically concentrated U.S. equity market could mean recommitting 
to both a thoughtful allocation to active management and diversification across all 
asset classes.

The Reshoring Experiment 

 ©2026 M&T Bank and its affiliates and subsidiaries. All rights reserved. 5 
The U.S. drive to reshore manufacturing activity and jobs via the use of tariffs is an 
experiment that, if successful, would unwind decades of movement to a globally 
integrated production and supply chain system. Importantly, the common narrative 
describes manufacturing job losses as a simple zero-sum game in which one country 
loses a job and another adds that job. The truth, though, is that much of historical 
manufacturing job losses stem from the ongoing automation of manufacturing 
processes that increase productivity and reduce the need for labor.
That said, overcoming the high relative cost of U.S. labor is a major challenge. In 
addition, higher-skilled labor is necessary to operate ever-more-sophisticated 
production methods.
As we start 2026, our scientific observation indicates that the use of tariffs as the 
main tool to spur manufacturing reshoring does not yet appear successful. In the near 
term, we continue to see more economic risks than rewards from these tariffs as firms 
and trading partners struggle to adjust in an environment of continuing uncertainty.
Over the longer term, if heightened tariffs remain in place, we expect them to 
encourage some gains in domestic production, though not enough to overcome the 
labor-cost disparity and generate manufacturing job growth. Instead, we see increased 
production coming from accelerated capital-intensive methods using AI, robots, and 
smart manufacturing1 techniques, all of which present investment opportunities.

Tariff impacts in 2026
Tariffs created a drag on the U.S. and global economies in 2025 and continue to pose a 
threat to further expansion in 2026. If the tariffs announced by President Trump in the 
Rose Garden on April 2, 2025 had been fully implemented, it would have amounted 
to an eye-watering 30% effective tariff rate—up from 2.5% on January 1 and sufficient 
to push the economy into recession.
For a variety of reasons (e.g., postponements, trade agreements, voluminous 
product exclusions, implementation lags, rerouting of shipments through lower-
tariffed countries, noncompliance), the effective tariff rate reached just 11% by the 
fourth quarter of 2025.2 That is still a substantial tax hike of roughly $275 billion per 
year—equal to about 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) and among the largest 
peacetime tax hikes in U.S. history (Figure 1).
The tariff hikes are somewhat mitigated by tax cuts from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act 
(OBBBA). Corporate taxes could fall by $137 billion in 2026, with the manufacturing 
sector as the largest beneficiary.3 That said, firms with substantial imports and low 
capital investment likely will see far less benefit. Consumers have been stung by 
higher prices on imported goods, leading to a slowdown in spending.
We expect tariffs to continue weighing on growth this year. OBBBA included personal 
income tax cuts that could help to soften tariffs’ impact. The bulk of these cuts only 
make existing tax rates permanent and do not affect current income. The new cuts 
(e.g., higher deduction for seniors, deduction for auto loan interest, no tax on tips or 
overtime pay, and a higher deduction for state and local taxes) amount to roughly 
$30 billion per year.4

Automation and the labor cost challenge
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the challenges facing this experiment. Domestic 
manufacturing jobs took a hit just after China joined the WTO (Figure 2), as many 
labor-intensive, low-value industries (such as apparel) outsourced their production 
overseas. The U.S. lost nearly six million jobs over 10 years and two recessions, and 
has added about 1.3 million after the losses bottomed out in 2010.
However, manufacturing output rose steadily over these recent decades, revealing 
a shift to more highly valued industries as well as higher productivity for the sector. 
Total output for the sector increased 17% from 2000 to 2024 even with the dramatic 
reduction in jobs.5
Remarkably, the turn to higher efficiency and productivity also has occurred in China, 
which has reported more than 15 million jobs lost in goods-producing sectors—
including manufacturing—over the past decade, while also raising output.6
These dramatic increases in productivity are not unprecedented. One hundred years 
ago, about 25% of U.S. workers were farmers. Yet even as that number has shriveled 
to 1.5%, food production has more than quadrupled.7 We do not expect manufacturing 
productivity gains to reverse, which would make the reshoring of jobs challenging.
New manufacturing techniques require highly skilled workers, and the U.S.’s high 
domestic labor costs are a disincentive for firms to reshore. Only Switzerland and 
Norway have higher total labor costs in the sector8 (Figure 3).

The reshoring experiment
We do not observe or expect that tariffs alone will suffice to induce a significant shift 
of production, especially for more labor-intensive products. Figure 4 is a stylized 
example comparing production costs for a pair of sneakers made in the U.S. versus in 
Vietnam, and the same for a leading-edge logic chip, a critical semiconductor device.
The former is an example of labor-intensive textile manufacturing that contributes to 
large-scale offshore production. Much of sneaker production is either fully automated 
or machine assisted, but labor still plays a significant role.
Shoes like this may retail for $100 but cost far less to produce (around $30 when 
accounting for materials, wages, and other costs such as administrative expenses 
and profit margins).9 Tariffs are levied based on the import value of the item, and in 
this case would apply to the $30 cost that the U.S. firm pays at the shipping dock. 
The current (as of November 2025) 20% U.S. reciprocal tariff rate on Vietnam would 
add another $6, bringing the total cost to $36, still well below the estimated U.S. 
production cost.
Labor costs are the critical differentiating factor making production in the U.S. more 
expensive. They have been reported at between $1 and $2 an hour for textile workers 
in Vietnam, while U.S. wages are 10 times higher10—bringing labor costs to $30 in this 
example and increasing the U.S. production cost to $63, or $33 higher than when 
outsourced (Figure 4). This implies that a 111% tariff would be required to equalize the 
cost of manufacturing a pair of shoes in the U.S. and Vietnam.
It would take a 100% tariff to make reshoring profitable on a per-unit basis, even 
before considering the higher fixed costs associated with construction of U.S. 
production facilities. At a reciprocal tariff level of 20% with Vietnam, it makes more 
sense for importers to pay the tariffs until the cost and scale of automated solutions 
for the labor-intensive steps of production are economically viable. Until then, 
these tariffs mainly serve as a source of government tax revenue at the expense of 
corporate profits and U.S. consumers.
Like textiles, semiconductors are a heterogeneous category that includes, for 
example, logic processors, memory chips, and analog components, each produced 
at varying scales and for distinct applications. For illustrative purposes, the example 
reflects the production of logic chips, which today occurs primarily in Taiwan, 
especially for the most advanced designs.
Manufacturing advanced semiconductors is highly automated and requires more 
skill, with smaller wage differentials between countries. For instance, production 
staff at TSMC, a leading chip producer, reportedly earn about $30,000 per year in 
Taiwan, while job postings for related roles at TSMC’s U.S. foundry in Arizona pay close 
to $50,000.11 These numbers place U.S. wages at roughly 67% more than those in 
Taiwan—a much smaller difference than the 10x wage gap in the textile example.

When all costs are factored in, manufacturing semiconductors in the U.S. is more 
expensive than in Taiwan, but the differential is less pronounced than in the case of 
textiles. A Goldman Sachs analysis found that operating expenses are 18% higher in 
the U.S. compared to Taiwan, and all-in expenses are 44% higher when factoring in 
other items, particularly the cost of capital expenditures (capex).12 Use of tariffs could 
be sufficient to tilt the balance of costs in favor of domestic production, particularly if 
combined with capex incentives.13
The calculus for whether such an investment is realistic hinges on more complex 
factors (notably the wealth of specialized knowledge that Taiwan has accumulated 
over decades of producing the most advanced chips, plus the extensive nexus of 
supply chains developed to support it). It is possible for a similar industry to be 
built in the U.S., but it likely would be a multi-year, multi-stage process that requires 
businesses to feel relative certainty about the policy framework going forward.
Based on the foregoing, products with very intensive labor input, such as sneakers, 
probably will remain imported goods and provide tax revenue. There are more capital-
intensive products that could be reshored, but we think it would take new investments 
in smart manufacturing techniques and other innovations to overcome the labor-cost 
differential. We also expect reshoring to be a gradual process over many years as 
technology develops and firms replace existing capital.
Lastly, we must not overlook the impact that future tariff uncertainty could have on 
corporate decision making. As with most experiments, if the observed results are not 
considered favorable, the experiment may be terminated. This possibility, whether 
within the timeframe of the current administration or beyond, also has a strongly 
depressive effect on corporate America’s interest in reshoring manufacturing.

Smart manufacturing, productivity, and profitability
Manufacturers’ net profit margins have accreted over the course of decades of 
globalization (Figure 5). We expect the clearing of regulatory and labor-cost obstacles 
for U.S.-domiciled manufacturing to depend heavily on smart manufacturing. Such 
technologies have taken a huge leap forward with generative and agentic AI. The 
latter builds on the power of generative AI’s large language models (LLMs) by adding 
the ability to learn, adapt, and be more proactive in accomplishing goals. These are 
necessary skills for many enterprise applications.
The potential improvements in predictive maintenance, quality control, and 
cooperative work between humans and collaborative robots (cobots), sometimes 
without any human oversight, could yield double-digit productivity gains for the 
industry over time.14 KPMG research projects a 20% reduction in production 
downtime, 15% increase in product quality, and 25% reduction in defect rates for 
manufacturers utilizing generative AI.15
However, investors may need to be patient. Researchers have documented a 
productivity J-curve—i.e., when initial investments result in a dip in margins before 
growth reaccelerates—that especially plagues manufacturing companies.16
Use cases of AI and robotics in smart manufacturing17
Collaborative robots (cobots) work alongside human workers to enhance 
productivity and safety while handling repetitive or physically demanding tasks.
Internet of Things (IoT) generates data from sensors, programmable logic 
controllers, deep learning,18 and AI algorithms to constantly update the digital model 
with live data and perform predictive maintenance.
Sensors can perform quality control with new precision.
Agentic AI can manage supply chains and inventory, and schedule system 
optimization.
We expect to see the greatest benefit from smart manufacturing accrue to 
companies that have high capital intensity (i.e., spend more on fixed-asset 
investment) or high labor costs and complex, customizable products. It helps to 
already have production facilities in the U.S. that could be expanded to increase space 
and expertise. Deep balance sheets are a must as well. If companies can profitably 
bring manufacturing supply chains back to the U.S., consumers could benefit from 
better, U.S.-made quality and lower shipping costs.

The greatest adoption of smart manufacturing has been in the automotive, 
electronics, and pharmaceutical industries (Figure 6). National security objectives 
in the pharmaceutical, energy, chemicals, and rare earths sectors could provide 
additional incentive to manufacture domestically.
Investing in industry 5.0
There are several interesting investment opportunities associated with the smart 
manufacturing theme that we are implementing in client portfolios.
Industrial capital goods providers present a compelling avenue to invest in 
automation, robotics, and smart building solutions associated with upgraded domestic 
manufacturing. In fact, industrial companies may be in the early stages of a multi-year 
super cycle. Valuations for the sector are not cheap, but industrials are trading at a 
narrower historical premium to the overall market (Figure 7).
AI software, specifically inference applications that focus and direct the computing 
power of well-trained LLMs, has the potential to streamline inefficiencies in the 
production process. Agentic AI could usher in a real boost to manufacturing 
productivity.
While generative AI models create content based on learned patterns, agentic AI 
more proactively applies model output to accomplishing goals or completing more 
complex tasks. For example, an LLM could create a travel itinerary, but an agentic 
AI model could book the trip. In the context of manufacturing, agentic AI has the ability 
to autonomously adjust schedules, diagnose supply chain issues and proactively 
reroute inventory, and predict maintenance-related issues.
We believe we have only begun to scratch the surface of agentic AI applications and 
their use cases, and that there is a long runway for software companies producing this 
technology.
Cybersecurity stands to benefit from smart manufacturing and AI adoption 
more broadly. An astounding 91% of respondents to a recent Deloitte survey of 
manufacturers reported cybersecurity breaches in the last year—yet just 32% of those 
respondents cited cyber risk assessment as a top priority.19
The higher the technology intensity in manufacturing or any other business, the 
greater the need for cybersecurity. Valuations of many cybersecurity companies have 
skewed rich for years, but it is difficult to understate future growth expectations for 
the industry. The coming advent of quantum computing also might trigger a super 
cycle in cyber investment.
Lastly, small companies also can benefit from shifting supply chains back home. 
Often, such firms lack the capital required to take advantage of the latest technology 
by making the investments to retrofit, enhance, or expand manufacturing facilities.
In these cases, the private markets can be a solution. Investors in both private equity 
and debt could benefit from earlier access to these operational-turnaround stories.

Replacing Workers 
with AI
The Labor Experiment 

 ©2026 M&T Bank and its affiliates and subsidiaries. All rights reserved. 15 
The move to reduce immigration is perhaps the riskiest experiment underway, as 
demographic trends are famously challenging to reverse and immigration policies 
could have lasting impacts. A simultaneous experiment is occurring in the business 
community, with implementation of AI replacing workers in a handful of job types where 
automation has been achievable. Labor demand has been hit even harder across the 
economy by a cyclical slowdown, highlighting the challenges of scientific observation in 
a noncontrolled experiment.
It is early days in these dual experiments, but our observations thus far indicate 
greatly reduced supply and demand for labor. Technology’s impact on labor demand 
is difficult to pin down and differs across industries and jobs—a truth seen throughout 
major past innovations, whether the steam engine, the automobile, the personal 
computer, or the internet.
Where a new technology acts as a substitute for labor—as AI has thus far—it puts 
people out of work. This is typical during the initial adoption phases. But as the new 
technology is integrated into business processes and new implementations are cooked 
up, it becomes a complement to workers, driving labor demand higher and increasing 
productivity.
We see the potential for a productivity boom emanating from AI, offering investment 
opportunities across the technology universe.
Near-term impacts of AI adoption
Concerns about AI replacing workers and hollowing out the labor force have run 
rampant since the release of ChatGPT. In our view, AI is a transformative technology 
that ultimately will create more jobs than it destroys, but there is mounting evidence 
that its impact thus far has been negative, especially in highly exposed jobs and for 
those early in their careers. In particular, AI may have replaced software engineers and 
customer service workers aged 22–25, reducing jobs by 20% and 10%, respectively, 
since late 2022.1 By contrast, there has been little impact for less-exposed occupations 
such as production supervisors, health aides, and stock clerks.
The dynamic of new technologies dampening labor demand in the early stages of 
adoption translates to a downside risk for job growth and consumer spending in 2026. 
We maintain a cautious view on labor markets and job growth in the year ahead before 
considering the AI impact. On the more positive side, we expect the reduction of the 
labor force, particularly the anticipated lower issuance of high-skilled H-1B visas, to 
mitigate the labor-market effects of AI-driven job losses for exposed sectors.

Dwindling labor force and immigration
Prior to the second Trump administration, the U.S. already faced a dramatic slowdown 
in population and labor-force growth. Net natural increase, which is simply births 
minus deaths, has been heading downward for years as the population ages and 
fertility rates fall (Figure 1). In this context, immigration increasingly has been a saving 
grace as a key source of fresh labor supply, but it is now being sharply restricted.
Even work visas for highly skilled workers (especially H-1B holders) could face 
a sudden decline due to new fees. The latest projections indicate that the U.S. 
population could dip into decline starting in 2031.2 The Congressional Budget Office 
(CBO) assumes that net immigration will average roughly 900,000 over the next five 
years, which may not materialize if current policies remain in place—meaning that 
population growth may turn out even lower than expected.
In fact, our calculations show that immigrants have almost entirely accounted for 
net job growth since 2022. That is not to say immigrants are taking jobs from U.S. 
nationals. Instead, it highlights the degree of slowdown and decline of the labor force’s 
native-born population.3 The unemployment rate for the native-born population was 
just 4.3%4 as of September 2025, so there is very little spare capacity for nationals to 
fill jobs that immigrants otherwise would have taken.
A vital concern for the U.S. going forward is the ability to fill high-skilled positions 
that have long been filled not only by citizens, but also by immigrants through the 
H-1B visa program (Figure 2). Since 1990, the program has enabled U.S. employers 
to hire foreign workers with specialized skills on a temporary basis. But the Trump 
administration instituted a $100,000 fee for new applicants as of September 2025, 
which could reduce applications by as much as 30%.5

Drawing highly talented immigrants has long been a signature characteristic of the 
U.S. economy, one that has boosted U.S. innovation and productivity. Skilled migrants 
make up just 5% of the workforce but earn 10% of total labor income, reflecting 
the higher-productivity positions and industry concentration. Overall, immigrants 
comprise about 10% of the U.S. population but make up 23% of patent holders. More 
than 25% of U.S.-based Nobel Prize winners have been immigrants,6 as are four CEOs 
of the so-called Magnificent Seven, the darlings of U.S. business and innovation.
Productivity boost needed
With the labor force slowing or perhaps even in decline, the U.S. economy is in dire 
need of stronger productivity growth. The simple math of long-term economic growth 
is that it equals the sum of the growth rates of the labor force and productivity. If 
immigration pulls back sharply enough that labor-force expansion is flat, it would 
take consistent 2% annualized productivity growth to achieve the current consensus 
estimate of 2% long-term economic growth. To put that in perspective, annual 
productivity growth was roughly 1% in the expansion between the global financial crisis 
and the pandemic. It was about 3.5% in the late-1990s and early-2000s boom.7
We believe that strong productivity growth is not only achievable, but also is the 
most likely outcome. A review of projections of annualized labor productivity growth 
from AI over the next 10 years yields a range of just +0.1% to +3.3%. That compares 
with the estimated +1% to +1.5% attributed to the internet boom of the 1990s. 
We expect a similar result from AI, boosting annual productivity by +1% to +1.5% over 
the next decade.
The magnitude of realized productivity growth will significantly depend on the success 
of AI. We see the new technology as likely to define a new era in growth, much like 
the adoption of electricity, the steam engine, the automobile, the personal computer, 
and the internet. But it also will be disruptive (as it already has been) for many 
industries and occupations. And we could be wrong, as the technology might fail to 
achieve its promise.

Adoption of AI is growing
While estimates vary, most signal that a high proportion of consumers have at least 
tried using AI.8 On the business side, research focused on large firms found that more 
than 80% had explored or piloted an AI solution, and 40% had deployed some kind 
of tool9 (Figure 3). A Census Bureau survey attempting to represent all firms showed 
much lower economy-wide usage, but rapid growth. Just 8% of firms had tried using 
AI as of October 2025, double the 4% from two years ago. Additionally, 14% indicated 
they plan to use AI at some point in the next six months.10
The data supports our view that AI Is likely to grow quickly, given the doubling of 
usage in such a short timeframe. But it also points to an experiment that still is in its 
very early stages, with a long road ahead before it is proven. We observe meaningful 
productivity gains at the microeconomic level, but do not expect to see economy-
wide gains with a measurable macroeconomic impact until further down the road.
Early innings of the AI investment cycle
Productivity growth is dependent on AI living up to—or exceeding—the recent hype. 
The echoes of 1999 are ringing loudly today, and the debate over an AI bubble is even 
louder. For investors, the most pressing question today is where we are in the AI 
investment cycle.
Unfortunately, this simple question has a complicated answer. We see the AI 
investment opportunity as multifaceted, with the different layers of the AI ecosystem 
presenting different degrees of value to investors today. Ultimately, the opportunity 
is a function of long-term demand for the technology, which is unknowable but hotly 
debated. We believe that we are still in the early innings of the AI investment cycle 
while recognizing the risks associated with over-investment and investor exuberance.

The great bubble debate
Myriad signs abound of over-exuberance associated with AI investment. Private AI 
firms like Anthropic and OpenAI command valuations of approximately $350–$500 
billion11 with no profits yet to show. We have seen a flurry of deal announcements 
amounting to chipmakers and hyperscalers taking stakes in AI platform providers, 
who then use the financing to increase orders of chips and cloud storage from those 
same companies. These headlines echo the telecom vendor financing deals of the 
dot-com era.
Hyperscaler12 capex has more than doubled since 2022,13 when ChatGPT was first 
released. It is projected to grow another 50% by 2027 to $520 billion14 (Figure 4), 
raising risks of over-investment that could be impossible to pay off.
But the opportunities, in our view, justify the risks. AI is not the internet. Adoption 
of LLMs has been immediate, and applications are barely scratching the surface. 
The productivity benefit could be larger and faster than that realized in the internet’s 
early days.
AI-related capex is still modest compared to the overall economy’s $6 trillion fixed 
investment.15 It also is funded largely with cash, though debt financing is increasing 
for some companies. Hyperscalers in the public market continue to generate 
tremendous free cash flow. The physical infrastructure buildout needed for our 
technology economy is still in its infancy and has not yet resulted in a debt bubble.
For all of the promise of this transformative technology, the stock market’s robust 
performance compels us to approach AI investments with cautious optimism. The 
faster and higher valuations climb, the more attention and intention are required to 
maintain appropriate diversification (we discuss this in a later section).
For now, we think we are still in the early innings of this super cycle, broadly 
speaking. Higher productivity could create a virtuous cycle for enterprise demand, 
but monetization is key. There still is value for investors in various parts of the AI 
ecosystem, in our view.

The AI ecosystem and portfolios
Infrastructure. The infrastructure layer of the AI ecosystem 
has been on the frontlines of investor enthusiasm, with capital 
flowing into semiconductors, hyperscalers, data centers, 
energy, and utilities.
Semiconductors may be among the more extended parts of 
the AI trade, at least in the near term. Demand is outstripping 
supply, and chip sales are on track to reach $1 trillion by 2030.16 
Future demand trends, however, are very difficult to predict 
and technological advancement can unexpectedly render 
inventory obsolete.
The combined market cap of the top 10 global chip companies 
has risen by a whopping 392% between mid-November 
2022 and October 2025.17 These large companies also face 
disruption risk, as AI chip startups have secured a total of 
$7.6 billion in global venture capital funding during the 
second through fourth quarters of 2024 alone18—a relatively 
small but growing figure.
Hyperscalers currently look appealing, as cloud infrastructure 
growth continues to accelerate while valuations are below 
prior peaks. The proportion of enterprise workloads in the 
public cloud has increased more than 60% since 2018 while 
their penetration remains just over 50%.19 The overall market 
opportunity for cloud infrastructure could increase tenfold 
by 2040.20 
Data centers, energy, and utilities are all related to the 
servicing of cloud and AI computing demand. Data centers 
have a development pipeline of 50 million square feet in 
the U.S. alone,21 and leasing demand from hyperscalers is 
reaccelerating. Current vacancy rates of 2.3% represent a 
record low.22
At the same time, valuations are becoming stretched, over-
investment risk is high, and energy is a major constraint. Many 
hyperscalers are building out their own data center capacity, 
leaving the investment opportunity more limited within real 
estate investment trusts and private real estate.
On the energy side, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates 
that data centers consumed 4.4% of U.S. electricity generation 
in 2023, a figure set to increase to 7%–12% by 2028.23 Public 
and private liquid cooling solutions look compelling, as servers 
for AI model training expend 20x more heat per server than 
standard computer cloud servers.24
Intelligence. AI model providers exist in the private and 
public markets, and valuations of private companies appear 
stretched. In the public market, hyperscalers like Alphabet, 
Meta, and Microsoft also are investing in model development 
and offer more reasonable valuations with diversified revenue 
streams. Still, these companies have become quite large, and 
aggressive growth projections could be harder to meet as 
they get larger.
Applications. Software applications will augment the 
productivity benefits of inference models, particularly through 
agentic AI. As described earlier, agentic AI is more proactive, 
autonomous, and adaptable than LLMs. It presents the added 
value of not only answering a question or generating content, 
but also of performing a task to completion.
With estimates for active users in the low-single-digit billions 
(Figure 5), monetization (specifically through enterprise 
pricing) will be critical to margin expansion.
We see the investment opportunity within software 
applications as in its early innings—in fact, almost too early. 
While some large software companies are implementing 
agentic AI, disruption risk is very high and it is generally too 
early to assess which companies will emerge as winners.
Adopters. Perhaps the most nascent-yet-exciting investment 
opportunities related to AI are the adopters of AI, that is, the 
businesses deploying the technology to realize new levels of 
efficiency. As we mentioned earlier, a J-curve trajectory is 
common for realization of productivity benefits associated 
with AI adoption, as early investments require retooling of work 
processes to fully realize the efficiency of the new technology.

Encouragingly, evidence does show that small businesses thus far have been the 
earlier and more agile adopters of AI,25 suggesting greater productivity gains for the 
businesses that arguably need it most.
Ultimately, we think the AI investment opportunity still has long legs. As with all 
new technologies, investors should anticipate volatility and pullbacks along the way. 
For example, the unveiling of the DeepSeek LLM almost a year ago triggered a 
15% selloff for the tech sector,26 which has more than recovered.
We expect such pockets of volatility to persist as AI technology matures and new 
winners or threats emerge. In fact, the prior decade’s winners rarely dominate 
the next decade, and we cannot rule out pain ahead for some of the largest and 
best-performing stocks of this cycle. As such, when economies realize transformative 
technological experimentation, fundamental analysis, active management, and 
diversification all assume greater import.

Investing in 
a Debt Cycle
The Debt Experiment

 ©2026 M&T Bank and its affiliates and subsidiaries. All rights reserved. 23 
The third major experiment should surprise no one: a global sovereign debt burden 
fueled by ever-growing deficits with no end in sight. The U.S. is projected to continue 
running unprecedented budgetary shortfalls in an economic expansion, and many 
other large economies are following suit. This creates the risk of an unsustainable debt 
trajectory, and observation thus far shows investors demanding higher interest rates 
to take on higher risk.
That said, we see two possible mitigants: stronger-than-anticipated productivity 
growth (especially in the U.S.) and the burgeoning stablecoin industry. The latter may 
prove an important new source of demand for U.S. Treasuries that could help keep a 
lid on rates. Higher rates in the U.S. also are, for the moment, encouraging a carry trade 
where international investors buy Treasuries to take advantage of their higher yields, 
increasing demand. Overall, a worsening debt picture affects the path of interest rates, 
the U.S. dollar, precious metals, and cryptocurrency.
A widening U.S. budget deficit
Government budgets are expected to deteriorate for most countries over the next 
several years. The U.S. finished fiscal year 2025 with a $1.8 trillion budget gap, roughly 
equal to 6% of GDP (Figure 1). That is down from about 6.3% of GDP in fiscal year 
2024, but is expected to expand to 7%–8% over the next five years.1

Investing in 
a Debt Cycle
The Debt Experiment

Continuing the trend from the past 20 years, the U.S. is projected to realize wider 
deficits than nearly all countries we consider in our investment process. The sum of 
projected U.S. deficits from 2026 to 2030 totals 39.2% of GDP, greater than all 
countries in developed and emerging market equity indices except for China.
Rising interest rates
The projected path for deficits and debt, all else equal, is likely to drive interest rates 
higher. There is considerable academic debate about whether annual deficits or total 
accumulated debt is more important.
Based on total accumulated debt, estimates across a range of studies find that 
each 1% increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio pushes long-term interest rates higher by 
two-to-three basis points (bps).2 The International Monetary Fund projects that the 
U.S. ratio will rise by 18% from 2025 to 2030, which would correspond with long-term 
rates moving up by 36–54 bps.3
Research similarly finds that annual deficits drive interest rates higher, but the effects 
can be larger and more volatile. This makes sense, as the path of deficits can shift 
fairly quickly with a turn in the economy or a change in policy. Accumulated debt 
moves more slowly.
We think current fiscal outlooks for most countries have been priced into markets, 
but could be susceptible to adjustments in 2026. In the U.S., a change in tariff policy 
(either from a Supreme Court decision or trade deals) could reduce expected tariff 
revenue and drive deficits—and, therefore, rates—higher. A slower economy also 
would raise deficits and rates, while a stronger economy would help bring both down.
Productivity to the rescue?
The prospect of stronger productivity growth stemming from AI discussed in Theme 
1 could have a profound impact on the U.S. debt outlook. The CBO currently projects 
debt to inexorably rise from 100% of GDP in 2025 to 109% of GDP in 2030 and 127% in 
20404 (Figure 2).

We think current fiscal 
outlooks for most countries 
have been priced into 
markets, but could be 
susceptible to adjustments 
in 2026. In the U.S., a 
change in tariff policy could 
reduce expected tariff 
revenue and drive deficits—
and, therefore, interest 
rates—higher.

But current productivity assumptions underlying the extended baseline forecast 
average only +0.9% per year from 2026 to 2030 and 1.1% thereafter. If productivity 
growth is just +0.5% stronger, the faster-growth scenario results in a downward bend 
of the debt-to-GDP curve (the “higher productivity” scenario in Figure 2), all things 
equal. To stabilize debt, all that is needed is for nominal GDP growth to exceed the 
average interest rate on the debt.5 That is achievable, and already the case, with the 
average interest on outstanding debt at 3.4% as of October 2025.6 The CBO’s baseline 
projection has nominal GDP growth falling from about 4.5% in 2025 to 3.5% over the 
forecast, but if AI is able to achieve the 1%–1.5% productivity boost that we expect 
and the primary deficit—the deficit before including interest payments—is small, then 
the government could run surpluses and pay down debt in coming years.
Should this come to pass, it will essentially mirror the late 1990s, when the 
personal computing and internet boom boosted productivity. In 1996, the CBO 
projected debt-to-GDP to rise from 50% to 52% over the next five years. But annual 
productivity surged to 3.5%–4%, driving strong economic growth and leading to 
budget surpluses. Debt-to-GDP fell to 31.5% by 2001.7
Rates and the housing market
One of the most important implications of the deficit and interest rates is their 
effect on the housing market. A housing market cycle starts with low interest rates, 
encourages purchases of new and existing homes, and helps consumers build wealth. 
It also leads to second-order purchases that support areas of the retail market 
(think home improvement) and the services economy.
Mortgage rates, which correlate with the movement of the 10-year Treasury note 
yield, declined in 2025 but are unlikely to fall below 4%–5% in the near term, absent a 
recession. (We cover more of our outlook for rates further along in this theme.) While 
lower interest rates and increased housing supply could improve affordability at the 
margin, more than 70% of existing mortgages have interest rates below 5% (Figure 3).

Nearly a Decade,” Redfin, February 6, 2025; Federal Housing Finance Agency, National Mortgage Database.

As indicated, it probably would take a recession for mortgage rates to fall enough 
below that level to meaningfully loosen the supply of existing homes and boost 
demand from first-time home buyers. This means that a virtuous housing cycle, which 
would be a tremendous tailwind for the economy, remains elusive for the time being.
Stablecoins could benefit Treasury securities
A key emerging technology that could affect Treasury markets—and push interest 
rates lower through increased demand for Treasuries—is the advent of stablecoins. 
The market has grown substantially, and issuers of stablecoins backed by the U.S. 
dollar accumulated $258 billion of backing assets as of August 2025 (Figure 4).8
To put that in context, only 15 countries had larger stockpiles of Treasury debt9 at that 
time. Stablecoin issuers purchased $40 billion of short-term U.S. Treasuries in 2024 
alone, rivaling some of the largest money market funds.10 If considered as a country, 
stablecoin issuers were the third-largest net buyer of Treasuries from the first quarter 
of 2024 to the same quarter in 2025, trailing only Belgium and the Cayman Islands.
We expect the fledgling stablecoin market to grow. Today’s usage is dominated by 
cross-border payments, where stablecoins are estimated to have a penetration rate of 
1.5%–1.9% as of the second quarter of 2025.11
To illustrate how stablecoin-based demand for Treasuries could grow from 2025 to 
2030, if U.S. dollar circulation abroad grew by 5% annually and the stablecoin 
penetration rate grew to 10%, stablecoins would need $1.9 trillion of backing assets by 
2030. What’s more, if that $1.9 trillion were deployed into Treasuries, it would dwarf 
today’s largest international holder (i.e., Japan at $1.1 trillion as of late 2025).12

Research confirms that the advent of stablecoins is affecting Treasury yields. 
Inflows of $3.5 billion into stablecoins reduced the yield on three-month Treasuries 
by 2–2.5 bps over a 10-day window through associated Treasury purchases.13 The flip 
side is true when stablecoins see outflows and issuers are required to sell Treasuries. 
In fact, observation reveals the negative impact of outflows to be larger than the 
benefit of inflows, at 6–8 bps for a comparable volume. 
While short-term Treasuries are the primary backing asset, issuers also hold 
short-term backing assets such as overnight repurchase agreements, money market 
funds, cash and bank deposits, and non-U.S. short-term debt. Issuers additionally 
hold other assets such as corporate bonds, precious metals, cryptocurrency, and 
secured loans. As the market matures, issuers could move into additional assets or 
possibly longer-maturity Treasuries, which would affect longer-term yields and 
possibly add volatility.
Investing in a debt cycle
From an investment standpoint, the U.S. and global debt trajectory elevates risk in two 
main areas: upward pressure on sovereign debt yields and fiat-currency14 debasement. 
The urgency of these risks increased in 2025 as the U.S., France, Germany, and Japan 
elected debt-tolerant officials or passed legislation to further expand their deficits.
Markets have taken notice. In 2025, U.S. and German 10-year yields hit their highest 
levels since the 2023 inflation scare, and the spread between German and French 
sovereign yields is the widest in 14 years.15 Though meaningfully below developed- 
market peers, Japanese bond yields are trading at a 17-year high. The U.S. dollar took 
a tumble in 2025 from a confluence of debt- and trade-related concerns, though it is 
well within its historical trading range.
An eye on rates
Over the next year, we anticipate further steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve. 
We expect the Fed to cut interest rates toward neutral—the long-term policy rate that 
neither stimulates nor contracts the economy—which could continue to drag down 
the short end of the curve (three-month-to-two-year yields). As we write, the market 
is already priced for a fed funds rate of 2.75%–3% by the end of 2026.
We see the 10-year fulcrum of the yield curve as heavily influenced by current 
economic growth, Fed activity, and long-term government debt projections. 
Absent a recession, we expect the 10-year yield to trade between 3.5% and 4.25%, 
perhaps moving modestly lower from current levels as the Fed cuts rates. 
If there is a recession in 2026, the 10-year yield probably could dip well below 
4% as the Fed cuts rates below neutral.
We expect the 30-year yield to remain attuned to any hint of increased Treasury 
funding needs or reduced investor demand, along with perceived threats to the Fed’s 
independence. This should keep the long end of the curve in a range of 4.5% to 5%. 
As we discussed earlier, however, realization of higher productivity could nudge the 
30-year yield lower toward 4.25%.
Over the next year, we anticipate 
further steepening of the U.S. 
Treasury yield curve. We expect 
the Federal Reserve to cut 
interest rates toward neutral—
the long-term policy rate that 
neither stimulates nor contracts 
the economy—which could 
continue to drag down prices of 
short-term Treasuries.

For investors seeking reasonably low-volatility carry, or income, this means that U.S. 
debt could remain attractive, especially compared to developed-market peers. 
A steepening yield curve warrants caution in extending duration,16 and credit 
spreads for municipal and corporate credit—both investment-grade and high-yield 
fixed income—are at historically tight levels, meaning that credit valuations are 
rich (Figure 5). We remain focused on fundamental credit analysis and prefer 
investment-grade debt over high-yield.
Historically, a steeper yield curve has correlated with outperformance of cyclical and 
value stocks, but the Fed often has cut rates well past neutral and steepened the yield 
curve into a recession. This time around, due to the recent bout of inflation, we expect 
the Fed to cut to neutral—not below neutral—and see more limited opportunity for 
value or higher-beta stocks (i.e., those with high sensitivity to movements in the 
overall market).
We retain an overweight to higher-quality companies, i.e., those with healthy balance 
sheets and consistent profits. This factor fell out of favor in much of 2025, but we 
expect these companies to deliver returns in 2026 that are more consistent with their 
long-term track record of adding value.
We additionally see a constructive outlook for bank profitability. The potent 
combination of a steeper yield curve, reduced regulation, and correspondingly 
higher deal volume could create a favorable environment for banks in 2026.

Deficits may bode well for metals and crypto
Persistent global deficits pose a risk to fiat currency generally and the U.S. dollar 
specifically, with precious metals and cryptocurrency as possible beneficiaries. 
The U.S.-against-the-world approach of imposing tariffs on all trade partners in April—
combined with the deficit expansion included in OBBBA and an increase in rate-cut 
expectations—presented a trifecta for U.S. dollar weakness early in 2025.
The dollar has stabilized since then and remains well within its historical range on 
a trade-weighted basis (Figure 6). We assess the U.S. dollar’s status as the global 
reserve currency to be secure in the near term. However, a transformed global trade 
landscape, new geopolitical alliances, and an unrelenting borrowing appetite could 
prompt investors and central banks to accelerate diversification away from the dollar.
Gold has long been viewed as a potential portfolio diversifier but, empirically, its 
contribution has been more about reducing asset correlations in the portfolio than 
adding to overall return. In fact, gold as an asset historically has stayed dormant for 
long periods, then produced outsized returns in very consolidated timeframes. We are 
on the heels of one of the latter periods, and gold’s cumulative 102% two-year return17 
looks extended in the short term (Figure 7).
Of course, gold offers no yield and has a spotty track record of hedging against 
inflation, dollar weakness, and volatility. Notwithstanding the science, the art 
of investing suggests the mosaic of macro factors present in today’s environment 
could make gold a more reliable contributor to portfolio return. We are watching a 
basket of precious metals (including some like platinum, palladium, and silver that 
have more industrial applications) for potential entry points to increase diversification 
in portfolios.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether are the other potential beneficiaries of 
a gradual shift from dollar dominance. After all, Bitcoin’s founding was based on the 
philosophical premise of banking decentralization and diversification away from fiat 
currency. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trades 
on the Ethereum blockchain and has vast potential use cases in smart contracts. 
It also offers a yield through direct investment associated with the proof-of-stake 
method of validating blockchain transactions. For these reasons, Ether also is worth 
following closely.
Much like gold, crypto has a fickle historical relationship with macro factors. It also has 
a relatively short history and is untested in the current new world order. Historically, 
crypto (focusing for now on Bitcoin) has not been the most effective hedge against the 
dollar, though an inverse correlation between these two assets has emerged in recent 
years. Crypto’s ability to hedge the dollar could improve with continued regulatory 
changes that broaden investment access and increase crypto’s staying power.
In the past year, we have seen more supportive regulation and even the establishment 
of a strategic crypto reserve by the Trump administration. Asset flows into crypto via 
newly created exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also have provided a significant tailwind. 
While crypto still is volatile and speculative, it has had fairly low correlations with other 
asset classes (Figure 8). We believe that a small allocation at the right price may add 
diversification benefits and longer-term returns for risk-seeking investors.

Economic experimentation requires investors to test new ideas, think outside of 
normal market constructs, and innovate. While the mixture of economic trends in 
global trade, labor-force growth, and debt require further observation as they 
play out over numerous years, these forces certainly inform our economic outlook 
and portfolio strategy in the year ahead.
Economic forecast
We have a cautiously optimistic outlook for the U.S. and global economies in 2026. 
Economic growth should slow to below 1% as the full impact of tariffs continues to 
weigh on consumer spending, job growth recedes, and capex outside of AI remains 
constrained. AI hyperscalers’ expected capex is a critical boost for the economy as 
other industries navigate the new laboratory of experiments and uncertainty.
Helpfully, the slower economy should continue to alleviate inflation pressures and 
enable the Fed to continue reducing rates. The 2025 tariffs boosted price pressures 
for many imported goods and supplies, but we see that as a one-time price increase 
and not enough to generate ongoing upward pressure. Consumers likely will continue 
reacting by spending less on services, which creates downward pressure on prices.
We expect the Fed to continue to cut rates in early 2026 and reach our estimate of the 
neutral fed funds rate of 2.75%–3.0% by the middle of the year.
Portfolio strategy in a time of experimentation
Public equity-market concentration, society-transforming technology, ample 
private-market capital, and the emergence of new asset classes are mixing in a way 
that is forcing investors to take a fresh look at diversification strategies.

A relatively small handful of companies has led the U.S. equity market for a while now, 
which has resulted in an incredibly concentrated, top-heavy market: The top 10 stocks 
in the S&P 500 make up the highest share of the index since March of 2000.1 A similar 
dynamic occurs in other regional markets, though their concentration tends to be less 
dominated by tech (Figure 1).
This market concentration has occurred at the same time as—and in large measure 
due to—the influx of capital into passive ETFs and other low-tracking-error vehicles. 
Such passive structures reinforce existing momentum, adding more money to the 
best-performing, largest companies in a capitalization-weighted index. These have 
been great companies—led by the tech giants—that have vastly out-earned the rest of 
the market and largely justified their premium valuations (Figure 2).
But concentration in anything creates risk. Because of their sheer weight, a turn of 
fortune for the largest 10 stocks, for example, will have a much more damaging impact 
on the market today than it would have 10 years ago. And it would be a rare occur-
rence to see the same stocks rank in the top from one decade to the next. 
All of this suggests that passive investors may not be as diversified as they may 
suppose. By contrast, we could be on the cusp of an active management resurgence. 
Active managers in aggregate tend to underweight the largest names. There are 
many reasons for this, ranging from skepticism about future growth projections to 
mutual fund risk guidelines that restrict individual stocks from exceeding a given 
portfolio weight.

Should the largest stocks fall out of favor, as they likely will at some point, active 
management is well positioned to potentially outperform. The active managers we 
find most compelling tend to invest in higher-quality companies. As mentioned 
earlier, quality is a factor we find particularly attractive today and over a long-term 
horizon. Accordingly, we believe seasoned managers could add significant value in the 
years to come.
Think small and private
Small-capitalization equities historically have provided textbook diversification. 
Compared to the largest names, they are thought to earn a return premium for the 
additional risk associated with smaller, higher-beta or riskier stocks and shine in 
different economic environments. But U.S. small caps have meaningfully lagged large 
caps in recent years (Figure 3), forcing a rethink on the best way to invest in the 
smallest companies.
The AI boom is leaving small caps behind. In the Russell 2000, a commonly cited 
small-cap index, the technology and communication services sectors collectively 
account for only 18%2 of the index value, compared to 45%3 in the large-cap S&P 500. 
The leading AI names thus far have been very large companies with massive balance 
sheets, equally impressive levels of cash, and the scale needed to compete in the 
technological arms race.
We also must consider the impact of private markets. Private-market capital has 
increased 220% in the last 10 years.4 Such ample liquidity encourages the most 
successful companies to stay private longer instead of raising capital via initial public 
offerings. This also degrades the quality of the public small-cap market, since the 
best companies are either staying private or entering the public markets as large-cap 
“unicorns.”

Fortunately, private equity is becoming increasingly accessible to investors,5 in part 
due to the Trump administration’s relaxation of the rules around private-market 
investment offerings in retirement accounts. For qualified investors, we increasingly 
look to diversify portfolios by investing in small companies via the private markets. 
Multi-strategy, commingled vehicles can offer immediate diversification potential in a 
market that can prove more challenging for building and diversifying exposure.
Observation in the real-world laboratory
Experiments rarely turn out exactly as anticipated, especially when they involve many 
variables. Shifting U.S. priorities could result in a more inward approach to policy, in 
turn calling into question the home bias (i.e., overweighting U.S. assets) we have 
employed—and benefited from—in portfolios. Our observational analysis thus far 
compels us to hold firm to our strategic asset allocations.
At the same time, it is imperative to continually challenge our investment assumptions. 
The role of crypto, precious metals, and other alternative assets in portfolios must be 
considered especially carefully today. For now, we do not recommend large allocations 
to crypto or precious metals (though our best thinking includes a modest allocation to 
commodities, of which precious metals are a portion).
We will continue to innovate our thinking, challenge convention, and prioritize risk 
management as stewards of your capital.
For qualified investors, 
we increasingly look to 
diversify portfolios by 
investing in small companies 
via the private markets. 
Multi-strategy, commingled 
vehicles can offer immediate 
diversification potential.

rather than any intrinsic worth.

16 We define bond duration as the measurement of a bond’s sensitivity to 
interest-rate changes, effectively estimating the percentage change in 
its price for a 1% change in interest rates. A bond with a longer duration 
is more sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations, meaning its price will 
fluctuate more than a bond with a shorter duration.

APPENDIX
DEFINITIONS
Capital expenditures (capex) refers to the money an organization or 
corporate entity spends to buy, maintain, or improve its fixed assets 
such as buildings, vehicles, equipment, or land. 
Cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio is a valuation metric 
used to assess a company’s or the market’s long-term financial 
performance.
Drawdown is a peak-to-trough decline during a specific period, quoted 
as the percentage between the peak and the subsequent trough.
Earnings multiples are used to quantify a company’s growth, 
productivity, and efficiency, and make comparisons among companies 
in an effort to find attractive investment opportunities. A multiple may, 
for example, be used to show how much investors are willing to pay per 
dollar of earnings, as computed by the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. 
Effective tariff rate is a weighted-average tariff rate that accounts for 
the tariff applied to the finished product and imported inputs.
“J-curve” is a plot of an investment’s performance versus time where 
the shape of the plot initially dips to negative values and then recovers 
to increasingly positive values, thereby producing a pattern resembling 
the letter “J.”
Large-cap stocks are those of public companies whose total market 
value, or market capitalization value, is more than $10 billion. They are 
generally considered less risky than small-cap stocks. 
The Magnificent Seven stocks are a group of high-performing and 
influential companies in the U.S. stock market: Alphabet, Amazon, 
Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia.
Market capitalization (market cap) is the value of a company traded 
on the stock market, calculated by multiplying the total number of 
shares by the current share price.
Price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio compares a company’s current market 
value to its operating cash flow. A lower P/CF indicates a potentially 
undervalued stock, while a higher ratio might suggest overvaluation.
Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company’s current share 
price relative to its earnings per share. 
S&P 500 index measures the stock performance of 500 large 
companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. and is one of the most 
commonly followed equity indices. 
S&P 500 Equal Weight Index (EWI) is the equal-weight version of the 
S&P 500 and includes the same constituents, but each company in the 
S&P 500 EWI is allocated a fixed weight, or 0.2% of the index total at 
each quarterly rebalance.
Small-cap stocks are those of public companies whose total 
market value, or market capitalization, is about $250 million to $2 billion. 
Small-cap stocks are generally considered riskier and more prone to 
wide market fluctuations than large-cap stocks.
Super cycle refers to a sustained period of expansion, usually driven by 
robust growth in demand for products and services.
