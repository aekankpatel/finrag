CET1 ratio decreased due to an accounting-related $2.1 billion capital reduction,
with management explaining, "That accounted for roughly 12 basis points of CET1
reduction in the quarter."
Management noted that regulatory and policy uncertainty persists, saying, "we're
still waiting for the rules to get Qnalized and they're multifaceted."
New proposals regarding credit card rate caps could adversely impact growth and
credit extension, with Moynihan stating, "if you bring the caps down, you're going to
get strict credit, meaning less people will get credit cards and the balance available
to them on those credit cards will also be restricted."

changes have negligible impact on net income, but did cause a modest, temporary
CET1 dilution.
Digital innovation, such as AI-driven customer interactions and product launches, is
directly credited with productivity gains and support for ebciency ratio
improvement.
Expansion in wealth management is evidenced by a $500 billion increase in client
balances, while new client acquisition and cross-selling efforts are accelerating in
both digital and physical channels.
Sales and trading growth is attributed to increased equities activity, especially in
Asia, and higher reimbursed transaction costs associated with global client
growth.
Client deposit growth has now turned positive in consumer banking, which
management points to as a powerful earnings engine for the franchise.

Lee McEntire:
Lee McEntire:
Lee McEntire: Thank you, Leo. Good morning. Thank you for joining us to review our
fourth quarter results. During the quarter, we elected to change the accounting method
related to our tax-related equity investments in order to better align our Qnancial
statement presentation with the economic and Qnancial impact of those investments.
As a result, we Qled an 8-K on January 6 and a related mini supplemental package
recasting the numbers for the quarters of 2024 and 2025 and the full year of '23 and
'24. The primary impact of the accounting change was a reclassiQcation between the
income statement line items in our income statement, which had an insigniQcant
impact on net income.
Our discussion today is based on those recast numbers. As usual, our earnings release
documents are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com
website. Those documents include the earnings presentation that we will make

reference to during the call. Brian Moynihan will make some brief comments before
turning the call over to Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to discuss more of the details in
the quarter. Let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and
refer to non-GAAP Qnancial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are
based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to
risks and uncertainties.
Factors that may cause our actual results to materially differ from expectations are
detailed in our earnings materials and SEC Qlings available on our website. Information
about non-GAAP Qnancial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also
be found in our earnings materials and are available on our website. With that, Brian, I'll
pass it over to you.
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan: Thank you, Lee, and good morning, and thank you for joining us. This
morning, Bank of America reported net income of $7.6 billion for the fourth quarter.
That is up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2024. Our EPS was $0.98 per share. That's
an increase of 18% from the fourth quarter of '24. We delivered 7% year-over-year
revenue growth. This was led by a 10% improvement in net interest income, up to
$15.9 billion on an FTE basis. For net interest income, we have delivered each quarter
what we laid out across the year and Qnished a bit stronger than we expected. We
grew average loans 8%.
We grew average deposits 3%, we delivered 330 basis points of operating leverage in
quarter 4 through continuing disciplined expense management. Alastair Borthwick will
take you through the details of the quarter. But Qrst, I want to highlight a few things
about 2025 to close the year out. I'm working off of Slide 2 in the earnings
presentation. Our fourth quarter topped off a strong performance by my teammates at
Bank of America for 2025. We delivered on our commitments to shareholders across
the year with solid growth across revenue, earnings and returns. We drove operating
leverage and continued robust investments in people, brand, technology in both our
physical and digital networks.
Those results revect the power of our diversiQed business model and our commitment
to drive responsible growth. Some highlights of 2025, you can see here, revenue was a
little over $113 billion, was up 7% year-over-year. We generated 250 basis points of
operating leverage for the year. Asset quality was strong and net charge-offs improved
from 2024. We grew net income year-over-year by 13%. In addition, we grew EPS year-
over-year to $3.81 or by 19%. We also increased our proQtability and returns during the
year. Return on tangible common equity improved 128 basis points. Our return on
assets improved to 89 basis points.
Our results and prudent balance sheet management allowed us to distribute 41% more
capital back to shareholders, more than $30 billion. We grew loans 8% and we grew
deposits 3%. Loans outpaced the industry and average deposits now have grown for
the tenth consecutive quarter. Our focus on all the markets we serve, whether they're
domestic or international, has allowed us to grow our client balances at a faster pace
than the industry. Dean described how we do this in the U.S. at our Investor Day, and

we will cover it later in the program. As you look to Slide 3, we've also highlighted some
organic growth highlights for the year and the quarter.
We grew net new consumer checking accounts by [ 680,000 ] during the year. And
that's while maintaining a strong average balance of $9,000 plus. This extended our
consecutive quarter net growth to 28 or 7 years straight. We crossed over $6.5 trillion
in client balances of investments, deposits and loans across Wealth and Consumer
Banking. Our consumer investment totals reached $600 billion. Similarly, our
workplace beneQts totals, i.e., 401(k) balances related balances crossed over $600
billion also. It's worth noting that $28 billion of our year-over-year loan growth came
through our wealth management clients.
Global Wealth & Investment Management showed improved nominal proQt growth,
stronger pretax margin improvement and continue to draw net new assets within the
combined consumer of $100 billion during the year. In Global Banking, average
deposits increased $71 billion, up 13%. We saw treasury service fees increased 13%
over '24 and ending loans go across each line of business year-over-year, good core
customer organic growth driving that. Investment banking saw good activity. For the
full year, our investment banking fees were the -- were the highest they've been since
going back to 2020 and the outside pandemic period recovery. They were 7% higher
than the prior year.
Fees generated in the second half of 2025 were 25% greater than the Qrst half. What
does this show? It showed good momentum by our team. It also showed that our
corporate commercial clients settled in during the year after tax policy being clear,
tariffs became more understood, and they look forward and receive the beneQts of
deregulation. Global Markets under Jimmy's leadership saw continued growth in sales
and trading with its 15th consecutive quarter of improvement and drove a record year
of nearly $21 billion in sales and trading revenue. In addition to these stats, I commend
you to review Slides 21, 23 and 25.
Those highlight the continued progress of digital deployment and activation statistics
for each of our businesses. You should note there the impact of Zelle and the
continued usage growth and also note the impact of Erica, our AI agent and its use
both across our businesses and with our teammates. A couple of high-level comments
on what we see in the economy. It was a pretty good decent environment as we move
through year 2025. Consumer spending grew 5% -- at $4.5 trillion grew 5% over the
2024 levels. Account balances in the consumer business, that broad base of the U.S.
consumer were stable through the year. Delinquencies and charge-offs improved in
2025 consumer credit.
Unemployment in the market remains stable, and the equity market appreciation
beneQt those consumers or investors in our Merrill Edge products or in our 401(k)
platforms. This strong consumer health bodes well for the continued improvement in
growth in 2026. When you go to our corporate commercial customers, again, as the tax
Advertisement

law settled in, the tariffs appear to be manageable and deregulation kicked in. They
had a pretty good year in good proQts, including good credit quality and good money
movement activity as we move through the year as they participate in the world
economy. A world-class research team has the global growth rate for GDP at 3.4% in
2026 and U.S. at 2.6%. Risks remain out there.
They always do, but we're encouraged and constructive on the head -- a year ahead. So
I'll turn it over to Alistair to cover the quarter.
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Thank you, Brian. I'll start using Slide 4. And as Brian noted, the
fourth quarter was a strong quarter for us with 7% year-over-year revenue growth and
good operating leverage producing $7.6 billion in net income or $0.98 in earnings per
share. Our EPS grew 18% compared to the fourth quarter of '24. Net interest income of
$15.9 billion on a fully taxable equivalent basis was strong and a little better than
expected, and we saw good momentum from market-based fees that complemented
the NII growth. Of the $28.4 billion in total revenue, $10.4 billion came from Sales &
Trading, investment banking and asset management fees. And those are 3 of the more
highly compensable market-facing areas.
It's these areas that grew revenue 10% year-over-year in the aggregate. On expense, the
teams have shown good discipline across the businesses as we held headcount vat
across the year despite the volume growth of clients and activity. Most of the year-
over-year expense growth was a result of revenue-related growth in markets and
wealth-based activities I just described and our continued investments in the
franchise. We saw productivity improvements through AI and digitalization more
generally, and those enabled us to add client-facing associates as we eliminated work
and roles in our operational support areas. This year, we brought another 2,000 college
graduates into the company, and we remain an employer of choice with progressive
beneQt programs for our employees.
And even with those additions, we managed to hold our headcount vat for the year
through good management. Provision and net charge-offs declined year-over-year.
That's for a second straight quarter, driven by continued stabilization around credit
card and lower losses in commercial real estate. The net charge-off ratio fell to 44
basis points and is down 10 basis points year-over-year. And lastly, we reduced our
average diluted share count by about 300 million shares or 4% from the fourth quarter
of '24. Slide 5 highlights the various earnings points that Brian and I have covered to
this point.
So let's transfer to a discussion of the balance sheet using Slide 6 where you see total
assets ended the quarter at $3.4 trillion, a little change from Q3 as securities and cash
reductions were replaced with loan growth. Deposits grew $17 billion from Q3 and we
use those deposits to continue to reduce wholesale funding as part of the plan we've
discussed previously to intentionally lower balances and drive a more ebcient balance
sheet. Average global liquidity sources of $975 billion remain very strong.

Shareholders' equity of $303 billion was up less than $1 billion as earnings and a
modest increase in OCI was mostly offset by capital return to shareholders.
In the quarter, we returned $8.4 billion of capital back to shareholders with $2.1 billion
in common dividends paid and $6.3 billion of shares repurchased, $1 billion increase in
share repurchase from Q3 revects increased earnings over the past 6 months and
some reduction in excess capital. Tangible book value per share of $28.73 rose 9%
from the fourth quarter of '24. Turning to regulatory capital. our CET1 level decreased
modestly to $201 billion, driven by a $2.1 billion capital reduction from making the tax
equity investment accounting change period, and we were not required to restate prior
period regulatory capital.
That capital reduction revects the timing of equity and proQtability in those investment
deals and comes back into our capital over the next several years as those deals wind
down. That accounted for roughly 12 basis points of CET1 reduction in the quarter,
again, that we'll get back over time. Risk-weighted assets rose $22 billion from Q3,
driven by loan growth. Our CET1 ratio then declined from 11.6% to 11.4%, and it
remains well above our 10% regulatory required minimum. Our supplemental leverage
ratio was 5.7% versus a minimum requirement of 5% as of December 31 and 3.75%
under the new rule, which we are adopting starting in 2026.
This leaves ample capacity for balance sheet growth and our $467 billion of TLAC,
means our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. On Slide 11, we
show a trend of average deposits and the consecutive growth across those periods.
Average deposits were up nearly [ 3% ] from the fourth quarter of '24, driven largely by
commercial client activity. Mobile Banking grew average deposit $74 billion or 13%
compared to fourth quarter '24. Our global capabilities, innovative solutions and our
relationship managers continue to offer clients value and access to our award-winning
digital platform in CashPro. Consumer Banking reported its third consecutive quarter
of year-over-year growth and low and no interest checking was up $9 billion or 2%.
Importantly, ending deposits improved sequentially in every segment. Team also
showed continued discipline on pricing while achieving that growth, overall rate paid
on total deposits of 163 basis points declined 15 basis points from Q3, revecting lower
rates and disciplined actions in our Global Banking and Wealth Management
businesses. Global Banking and Wealth Management rate paid both declined 28 basis
points from Q3. The rate paid on the roughly $945 million of consumer deposits fell 3
basis points to 55 basis points in Q4 and remains low driven by the operating nature of
that account base and that client base. Let's turn to loans by looking at average
balances on Slide 8.
Loans in Q4 of $1.17 trillion improved $90 billion or 8% year-over-year, driven by 12%
commercial loan growth. Consumer loans grew at a slower 4% year-over-year pace and
importantly, we're up across every loan category of card, mortgage, auto and home
equity. For the Qfth quarter in a row, every business segment recorded higher average
Advertisement

loans on a year-over-year basis. While commercial loan growth has been driven by our
Global Markets Group, we've also seen year-over-year growth of 3% in Global Banking
and strong custom lending growth of $18 billion year-over-year in Wealth Management
as aÄuent clients borrowed for investments in assets like hospitality, sports, yachts,
arts and business.
In addition, small business saw its 12th straight quarter of year-over-year lending
growth. Let's turn our focus to NII on Slide 9, where on a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q4
was $15.8 billion. And on a fully taxable equivalent basis, NII was $15.9 billion. And as
I said earlier, that's up 10% from the fourth quarter of '24. On a fully taxable equivalent
basis, NII grew $1.4 billion year-over-year, and $528 million over the third quarter.
Our growth was driven by several factors: First, we saw good core NII performance
from loan and deposit growth and disciplined pricing; second, we beneQted from asset
repricing as higher-yielding loan growth, replaced loan and security maturities and
paydowns; third, client activity in Global Markets drove more of the sales and trading
growth through NII than fees this quarter compared to Q3. That was about $100
million more of a shift in global markets activity to NII from MMSA than we had
originally anticipated.
And lastly, we had a small beneQt from an average Fed fund rate, which primarily
impact our liabilities dropping more than the way average SOFR rates behaved on
variable rate assets, so we had a slight beneQt there. Our net interest yield, NIY,
improved 7 basis points from the third quarter to 208 basis points, revecting the
growth in NII, while the earning balance remains stable as higher-yielding loan
balances replaced lower-yielding securities. And as I said earlier, higher deposits
allowed us to reduce wholesale funding while cash balances declined. Regarding
interest rate sensitivity, on a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a 12-month change in
NII for an instantaneous shift in the curve.
That means interest rates would have to move instantaneously lower by another 100
basis points more than the 2 expected cuts contemplated in the curve. On that basis, a
100 basis point decline would decrease NII growth over the next 12 months by $2
billion. And if rates went up 100 basis points, NII growth would beneQt additionally by
approximately $700 million. With regard to a forward view of NII, let me give you a few
thoughts.
At Investor Day in November, we indicated our expectation that we would see 5% to 7%
growth in net interest income in 2026 compared to 2025, and that's still our belief
today based on the latest interest rate curve, which includes 2 rate cuts in 2026. To
reiterate our expectation from Investor Day, we expect good core NII performance from
loan and deposit growth that will additionally beneQt from sizable Qxed asset repricing
and cash vow swap repricing to drive the 5% to 7% NII improvement.

During 2026, we expect roughly $12 billion to $15 billion in combined mortgage
backed securities and mortgage loans to roll off quarterly, and those will be replaced
with new assets at 150 to 200 basis points higher in yield or they'll allow us to pay
down expensive short-term debt. For Q1 NII expectations I would use Q4 as a base
after excluding about $100 million or so for the shift in Global Markets client activity
that I referenced, that is likely to be offset in MMSA. So simply a change in geography
that's revenue neutral. I'd also note, we have 2 less days of interest in Q1 than Q4.
And of course, we had a 25 basis point rate cut in December. Still we expect Q1 NII will
grow roughly 7% from Q1 '25 based on the assumptions on Slide 18, in line with our full
year guidance. Okay. So let's turn to expense and we'll use Slide 10 for our discussion.
This quarter, we reported $17.4 billion in expense, up a little less than 4% year-over-
year. When combined with our 7% revenue growth, this good expense management
allowed us to generate more than 300 basis points of operating leverage, and that
aligns to our target for the medium-term operating leverage range that at Investor Day.
The increase in expense was mainly driven by incentives tied to revenue growth and
higher brokerage clearing and exchange costs, or BC&E, costs from trading activity.
Those BC&E costs revect client activity shifting toward higher growth and higher
transaction cost overseas markets. Now these costs are the ones that are generally
reimbursed by the client, so they're included in our revenue essentially offset one
another. If we isolate change in expense for the incentives tied to Wealth Management,
and remember, that revects a 13% year-over-year improvement in asset management
fees and we isolate the BC&E costs that supported a 10% increase in sales and trading
revenue.
Then combined, they represented roughly 2% of our expense growth for the year and
they came with good revenue. Beyond that, productivity improvements from AI and
digitalization continued to help offset higher wages, beneQts and technology
investments. Headcount remains our key driver of expense from compensation and
beneQts to real estate and technology. And we manage this closely, not only in total
numbers, but also an organizational structure aiming to strike the right balance of
managers and teammates. Since the end of 2023, we've operated within a tight range
of 213,000 employees. This year, we hired about 17,000 new teammates just to
replace departures from what was a very low attrition rate.
And every time someone leaves, we take the opportunity to evaluate whether the role
needs to be replaced. [ Coming to ] the third quarter. Noninterest expense was up
about $100 million, driven by technology investments and wealth management
revenue-related costs. That was partially offset by a $200 million net beneQt from the
combined impact of the reduction of the FDIC special assessment accrual and some
other settlements that modestly increased litigation expense. Looking ahead, our
focus remains on delivering operating leverage for shareholders. We expect to
generate about 200 basis points of operating leverage in 2026. Those expectations
include a constructive fee environment that complements our expected NII growth.
Advertisement

We've seen encouraging momentum in asset management fees, investment banking
and Sales & Trading, and we look for that to continue. And importantly, if revenue
comes in below our expectations, then obviously, revenue-related expense will be
lower. As for Q1, we typically see seasonal strength in sales and trading activity and
elevated payroll tax expense. Combined with the absence of the FDIC beneQt we saw
in the fourth quarter and combined with ongoing productivity improvements, we
expect Q1 expenses to be about 4% higher than Q1 of 2025. And even with that, we
still expect to deliver operating leverage. Let's now move to credit and turn to Slide 11.
And where you can see asset quality remains sound with small improvements in
several key indicators. It's not a great deal to cover here. Our net charge-offs were $1.3
billion, down about $80 million from the third quarter and driven by lower losses in
commercial real estate. Total net charge-off ratio this quarter was 44 basis points,
down 3 basis points from the third quarter and down 10 basis points from Q4 '24.
Provision expense in the quarter was $1.3 billion and mostly matched net charge-offs.
Focusing on total net charge-offs looking forward in the near term, we expect
continued stability in total net charge-offs, given the mostly benign consumer
delinquency trends and low unemployment data, the continued stability of C&I and
reductions in our commercial real estate exposures. On Slide 12, in addition to the
consumer delinquency statistics, note the modest changes in other stats for both our
consumer and commercial portfolios. Let's now turn to the performance across our
lines of business, beginning with Consumer Banking on Slide 13. Our Consumer Bank
had a strong year. And for the full year, the team generated $44 billion in revenue and
delivered $12 billion in net income.
Net income grew 14% from 2024, and we earned a 28% return on allocated capital. In
Q4, Consumer Banking delivered strong results, generating $11.2 billion in revenue, up
5% versus the fourth quarter of last year and $3.3 billion in net income up 17%. So a
really strong Qnish to the year. These results revect the value of our deposit franchise
and underscore both the breadth of our platform and the success of our organic
growth strategy and digital banking capabilities. Our focus on client experience and
investments in both physical and digital capabilities, combined with more investment
in product innovation and rewards drove the strong results.
Business was also managed well for shareholders as we grew expense less than 2%,
allowing us to improve our ebciency ratio to 51% and deliver nearly 350 basis points of
operating leverage. This 2% expense growth revects our continued investments in our
brand, highlighted by our minimum wage increase to $25 earlier this year and
incentives for more production. Digitalization and early utilization of AI helped offset
some of the investments. Consumer investment balances grew $81 billion from Q4 '24
to nearly $600 million, supported by $19 billion in full year client vows and market
appreciation. Average balance per investment account at $147,000 is up 12% from last
year.

And this investment platform serves as a great catch basin for Qrst-time investors and
for more experienced investors looking to manage some element of their own money.
As mentioned, consumer net charge-offs improved again on a year-over-year basis,
and we continue to see stability in asset quality metrics. Credit card net charge ratio of
3.4% improved nearly 40 basis points from Q4 and improved linked quarter. Finally, as
shown in the appendix, this is Slide 21. You can see strong digital adoption and the
engagement that all continued, and the customer experience scores remain strong,
revecting the impact of our ongoing investments in digital. Turning to Wealth
Management on Slide 14.
And you can see this is a business that has strong momentum right now, and we've
improved growth as we work towards the medium-term targets laid out at Investor
Day. For the full year, revenue of $25 billion grew 9% compared to 2024, and net
income grew 10% to nearly $4.7 billion. Over the past 3 quarters, net income has gone
from $1 billion in Q2 to nearly $1.3 billion in Q3 and to $1.4 billion in Q4. Return on
allocated capital went from 20% in Q2, up to 28% in Q4. And the pretax margin has
climbed back into the high 20% range as we ended the year.
Underneath all that, client balances grew $500 billion across the year to $4.8 trillion
and that included strong ending loan growth of nearly $30 billion or 13%. Within that,
AUM vows were $82 billion and total vows of 80 -- sorry, [ $96 billion ]. And coupled
with the vows of consumer investments, we saw $115 billion of well vows for the Qrm
this year. And for the year, Maryland, the Private Bank added 21,000 net new
relationships with the average size of new relationships continuing to grow across
both businesses. Importantly, we're not just growing relationships, we're deepening
them as we added 114,000 new bank accounts this year.
And Qnally, I'd highlight the continued digital momentum as shown on Slide 23, where
new accounts have increasingly opened digitally, underscoring the effectiveness of our
digital investments and the evolving preferences of our clients. On Slide 15, you see
the results for Global Banking. The team had a good year and generated $7.8 billion in
earnings and that represented about 25% of the company's overall net income. Year-
over-year earnings were down a modest 2% as a result of interest rate cuts impacting
NII from the variable rate assets in the business. [indiscernible] grew average deposits
$71 billion or 13% and grew loans $12 billion.
This included the addition of roughly 500 new clients in middle market, banking and
more than 1,000 in business banking that chose Bank of America as their Qnancial
services provider in 2025. For the fourth quarter, Global Banking delivered net income
of $2.1 billion down 3% year-over-year with a 6% improvement in fees overcoming the
NII pressure. Business remains very ebcient with a 50% ebciency ratio and we earned
16% return on allocated capital in Q4. We generated $1.67 billion in investment
banking fees, up modestly over Q4 '24. And we maintained our #3 position for the full
year.
Advertisement

And as Brian and I said earlier, investment banking fees showed good momentum,
given all the regulatory and tariff announcements around the globe uncertainty settling
in and our pipeline remains strong. Noninterest expense grew 6% compared to last
year as we position the Qrm for the future with continued investments in technology
and bankers. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 16. I'll focus my comments on
results that exclude DVA as we typically do. The Global Markets team produced a
record year of record -- sorry, a record year of revenue, improved earnings and solid
returns. We generated $24 billion in revenue for the year, and that exceeded last year's
revenue by 10%.
Earnings of $6.1 billion for the year were up 8% and the business generated a 13%
return on allocated capital. It's worth noting this is the 12th consecutive quarter of
year-over-year net income growth. Q4 Global Markets generated net income just shy of
$1 billion, up 5% from Q4 '24. Revenue, excluding DVA, grew 10% year-over-year driven
by strong sales and trading performance. And focusing on Sales & Trading, revenue ex-
DVA, rose 10% year-over-year to $4.5 billion. And it was equities trading that led the
improvement, growing 23%, supported by increased activity in Asia.
And that brought higher revenue, it also brought higher revenue -- sorry, higher cost in
the form of transaction costs as the clients still reimburse us for those fees.
[indiscernible] revenue grew 1% driven by improved performance in macro rates and FX
products offsetting a modest decline in credit products. Loan growth continues to
beneQt from opportunities tied to highly collateralized pools of high-quality assets and
clients value our expertise and in delivering these solutions. On Slide 17, all other
shows a loss of $132 million in Q4, with very little to cover here. And as we wrap up, I
would just note Q4 effective tax rate was 21%, and it was 19% for the full year.
For 2026, we expect an effective tax rate of roughly 20%. And then Qnally, I'd just note
on Slide 18, we provided a summary of the forward-looking guidance that we
discussed today. So I'll stop there. Thank you. And with that, we'll jump into Q&A.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our Qrst question comes from Betsy Graseck with
Morgan Stanley.
Betsy Graseck:
Betsy Graseck:
Betsy Graseck:
Betsy Graseck: Thanks so much for all the detail here. I did just want to understand
one thing on the outlook as we're thinking about the expense ratio. I know that you've
got the accounting change, and you also have outstanding guidance for the expense
ratio over the medium term, I believe it is 55% to 59%, is that right?
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Right.
Betsy Graseck:
Betsy Graseck:
Betsy Graseck:
Betsy Graseck: Okay. I'm wondering, are you going to be adjusting that expense ratio
guide given the accounting changes that you have made in this quarter?
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Well, I don't think -- so at this stage, Betsy, but similar to our
comments at Investor Day, the numbers that we put out aren't a cap on our ambition.
Advertisement

So obviously, as we go through the course of the next couple of years, if we improved
our ebciency ratio by a couple of hundred basis points this year, we're going to keep
driving towards that range. And once we get in that range, we'll reassess and we'll
consider whether it's time to consider a lower ebciency number in the future.
Betsy Graseck:
Betsy Graseck:
Betsy Graseck:
Betsy Graseck: Yes, I was just thinking mechanically with the accounting change, the
revenues improve, right? So with the denominator moving higher, shouldn't that target
expense ratio of 55 to 59 move down a percentage point on each side?
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Well, remember, we recast the prior periods. So that's already in
there when you use the comparative periods. And I think part of the reason that it was
important for us just to recast all the numbers and adopt the accounting is because
that's how our competitors showed their results. So now we feel like it's on a
comparable footing.
Operator:
Operator:
Operator:
Operator: We'll now move on to Ken Usdin of Autonomous Research.
Kenneth Usdin:
Kenneth Usdin:
Kenneth Usdin:
Kenneth Usdin: So [indiscernible] just a follow-up, Alastair, you made the point about
just your outlook for fees is strong, and obviously, there will be compensation aligned
with that. So just coming back on expenses in an absolute sense with 4% year-over-
year growth expected in the Qrst quarter. And I know everyone is just thinking about
just how do you get to this operating leverage algorithm. Is that around what you're
expecting just absolute expenses to grow given your underlying base of good fee
growth in there?
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Well, I think what we're trying to convey is, and we've said this over
the course of the past several years. Ours is an organic growth company. We're
investing for growth all the time. And when we perform the way that we believe we can,
we're going to create operating leverage every year. That's what our North Star is in
terms of the Qnancial model. So we've guided you towards NII, up 5% to 7% this year.
We've said in the Qrst quarter, we believe the Qrst quarter will be up 4% or so. We've
said that we expect the operating leverage to be a couple of hundred basis points.
So that should allow you to work backwards into the expense side of the equation,
especially since we've given Q1 essentially. And then I think it would just depend on
your revenue assumptions regarding assets under management fees, markets and
investment banking because those will be the big drivers. And yes, we remain
constructive on all 3 of those.
Kenneth Usdin:
Kenneth Usdin:
Kenneth Usdin:
Kenneth Usdin: Okay. Got it. And then so -- as you think about your -- when you talked
about the Investor Day, you talked about a 200 to 300 basis point range. So obviously,
each year is going to be different things, but you've got -- with a strong base of NII
growth and fee growth and we're on the 200 side, what are the things you could do to
kind of longer term expand that and potentially get back -- to get up to the 300 side of
Advertisement

that 200, 300 range that you had given us in November?
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Well, I think one of the things we've talked about when we went
back to Investor Day, and this gets back to driving return on tangible common equity
over time. You think about the fact that we've just gone from 13% to 14% last quarter.
Prior quarter, we were at 15%. We Said we're going to get in that 16% to 18%. If you
think about the organic growth opportunity we have around deposits and loans, and
then you add the Qxed rate asset repricing that drops to the bottom line. And then you
combine it with the fee growth that we've talked about.
When we manage expense carefully as we have done this year and headcount vat, sort
of the core expense minus BC&E and incentive comp closer to 2% type growth. Then
you'd look at something that gets pretty interesting over time. So that's what we're
trying to drive over a period of time. And you're right, it won't always show up every
year where it's exactly the same. But what we're trying to do, most importantly, drive
organic growth, keep our expense discipline. That's it.
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan: So Ken, the number one thing is to continue to let the headcount --
work the headcount through operational excellence and applications of new
technologies, including AI that we gave you some sense for. So as we told you at
Investor Day, today's activity in Erica in our consumer business alone is worth
thousands of teammates that we don't have to have to do the great work we do for the
customers. So we've applied digital, and that's why I put the pieces in the deck that you
can see in the Pages 21 and beyond. We apply the digital capabilities now AI
capabilities.
And you saw during the year, the headcount was basically vat while we added more
people in the Qeld facing off the clients and generating new client vows. And that's why
when Alastair talked about the middle market business, particularly in the private bank
business, why we're seeing strong growth there. So it's going to be about bringing up
the numbers of people down over time, and we expect the headcount to come down
during this year.
And each month, we get the -- to maintain neutral headcount, we have to hire at a 7%,
7.5% turnover rate, you got to think it's higher than 1,000-plus people so we can just
make decisions not to hire and let the headcount drift down. The team has done a
good job of we ended the year basically vat. And we absorbed, as Alastair said, 2,000
very talented teammates from colleges in July. And by the end of the year, we were
down to 2,000 people and end up back net neutral. So that's what you're going to get
there.
If you look at the expense load, it comes from people and it comes from the beneQts
and compensation, and it ultimately comes from the buildings and computer systems
to allow them to do the great job for clients. So that's what we're working on.

Operator:
Operator:
Operator:
Operator: We'll now move on to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Michael Mayo:
Michael Mayo:
Michael Mayo:
Michael Mayo: If you could just give more of an update on technology. What do you
expect your spend to be this year versus last year, your spend on AI? And then Slide 21,
again, we -- I think everybody appreciates the data you provide on your digital
engagement, which is more than others. But no good deed goes unpunished. I'm just
looking at Slide 21 and your interactions in consumer with Erica took a dip down in the
last year, even while your users go up. So if you can talk about the spend investments
and the results from Tech and especially AI.
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan: Yes. So Mike, we'll be up on initiatives this year, 5%, 6%, 7%, I think,
types of numbers. Total spending [ $13 billion, plus $4 billion ] plus in initiatives, that's
all new code. And in that spending, remember, also we get the advantage of all the
other people. So for example, under the 365 CoPilot rollout, which is now out across a
total of 200,000 teammates and using it and learning from it, we expect to get good
leverage of that. So that's an increase in the run rate year-over-year.
So that's -- the technology is increasing, the technology number is sizable and the team
does a good job in implementing change every weekend, frankly, except for 1 a year. So
we feel good about that. One of the things that you'll note is you use these
technologies and combinations. So your point on Erica, I asked the same question,
Mike, because it's pretty straightforward why would the interactions of the Erica could
go down. The reality of that is -- well, we don't show is the amount of alerts that we
deliver.
So you can set up alerts which then has slowed down the need for Erica because the
alerts are up to, I think, billions a quarter that are telling you when you're balanced low
and things like that, that avoid you go in and asking the question. So that combination
of things is growing very quickly.
So again, what you always try to do is look at a process from a customer to you and
Qgure out how you can get that customer the best client -- the best customer
experience at the lowest cost so you can plow that back into the low fee structures,
which help us grow the business for, as we said, for 7 straight years in [ checking ]
accounts. So there's a technical explanation on the Erica that is a little bit different. But
thematically, you can see just the digital enablement just continues to grow and
continues to help us leverage our franchise and frankly, consumers now pushing
through 50% proQt margin, and it will continue to go up.
Michael Mayo:
Michael Mayo:
Michael Mayo:
Michael Mayo: Okay. And speciQcally on AI investments, like how much do you spend
on that? Or the number of people, if you could dimension that and kind of what kind of
outcomes you're looking for, especially as we say here at the start of the year?
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan: Yes. Well, we're looking for -- we have the -- we have -- to give you an
example, we have 18,000 people on the company's payroll who code. And we've using
Advertisement

AI techniques. We've taken 30% out of the coding part of the stream of introducing a
new product to service or change that saves us about 2,000 people. So that's how
we're applying it. That was this year's statistic, meaning '25. Next year, we should get
more out of it as we Qgure out and apply it across. So there's different projects going
on in the company. I don't know off the top of my head the total expenditure, but it's
several hundred million dollars.
Importantly, we're going through the company to generate more ideas how to apply AI.
And I use example like our audit team has built a capability they think a series of
prompts around doing audits and stuff to allow them to shape the head count back
down that they had to grow during the regulatory on side over the last few years.
They're going to be able to bring that down in AI, they'll be able to bring it down further,
and they've laid out plans to do that. And so that's going on everywhere.
But that was organic from there starting to use the copilot capabilities and then
learning how to do the prompts and then using it to set up audit practices. So you're
seeing it everywhere in the company. So there's, I don't know, 15, 20 projects going on,
and there will be a laundry list of much bigger size as we go through the company now
and are generating ideas now that people are using it and getting used to how to use it.
Operator:
Operator:
Operator:
Operator: We'll now move on to John McDonald with Truist Securities.
John McDonald:
John McDonald:
John McDonald:
John McDonald: One of the other levers for the ROTCE ambitions that you guys have
talked about is the denominator with the CET1 ratio. Could you talk a little bit, Alastair
or Brian, about the time line for kind of where you are today with [ 11.4% ] to the target
you laid out, which I think was around mid-10s?
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan: Yes. I think, John, if you think about that we're still, as you well know,
and your colleagues will now, we're still waiting for the rules to get Qnalized and they're
multifaceted rule set that we got to make sure how it applies. But our goal, we
appealed from 11.6% to 11.40%. And you're going to keep peeling that number down
through expansion of our markets business, expansion of lending and other uses of
RWA and so -- and we bought back a little more stock than in dividends than we
earned. And so we'll keep working that down. But the idea is not to take the $200
billion-ish nominal and reduce that a lot.
The idea is to use the excess to grow the balance sheet and let that work down as we
see the Qnal rules, the constraint may be sort of to common equity ratio stuff or $6.20.
Could you be in the mid- to high 5s or something like that, that might be possible. And
if you -- so we'll let this all drift down over time. And so just expect us to keep buying
back -- to paying the dividend, increasing it and buying back the stock. And remember
that as you said, we've drifted down a little bit by growth, but also the accounting
change hit it, which will repeat. So the next quarter we'll keep walking it down.

Just the idea is as this will settle in, then maybe we can be more aggressive, but we
got to know exactly what we're dealing with.
John McDonald:
John McDonald:
John McDonald:
John McDonald: Okay. And then maybe if we pull back just the broader timeline on the
ROTCE path. It looks like for 2025, you kind of ended in the 14, low 14s. What's the
ambition to get to the lower end of the 16 and then the 18 over time.
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan: I think we made it clear that you had -- and by the 8th quarter to the
12th quarter, you move in the lower part of the range and then the upper part of the
range given a core economy growing it to 2.5% type of number. So -- and all the other
attributes. So we made that clear. So that's basically 8 quarters from -- including this
quarter, obviously, Qrst quarter '26 and then we move into the 16 level, and then we
move to the upper end of the range as we move through the third year.

Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Yes. So embedded in our NII assumption is loan growth in the
mid-single digits Matt. Obviously, we've had pretty good loan growth this year, kind of
$20 billion a quarter or so. A decent amount of that has been on the commercial side.
And we highlighted that in our Qnancials and in our commentary earlier. So we're still
seeing the growth in each of the consumer categories. And that feels like it's in a
position where it's likely to continue to grow from here. So we feel pretty good about
those 2.
I don't see any reason that it would be a whole lot lower necessarily than it was last
year, but last year was a good 1 year, no question. So that's why we're saying mid-
single digits. I think it will still be led by commercial. But you see the consumer
categories picking up.
Matthew O'Connor:
Matthew O'Connor:
Matthew O'Connor:
Matthew O'Connor: Okay. And then I guess, speciQcally in credit card, the spending
was good, up 6% year-over-year or the balances were up just a couple of percent, fees
were down. I know at Investor Day, you talked about accelerating the growth there.
Maybe just update a little on kind of the initiatives there and the timing.
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Yes. So [indiscernible] was very clear about this at Investor Day.
It's our intention to continue to accelerate the growth in card. I think we've seen that in
the last 3 or 4 quarters. It's picked up sequentially quarter after quarter. And if you
were to look at what the team is doing right now, they're investing a little more for
future growth. So you can see that in some of the things we're doing around the World
Cup this year. You can see it in some of the things we're doing around more rewards in
November. You can see it in our rewards program with our co-brand partners.

And you could see it in the June cash back rewards offering. So we've got a lot of
things going on right now that we're excited about. We know what we've committed in
terms of higher credit card growth, and we feel like we're on the right path.

Operator: We'll now move on to Erika Najarian with UBS.
L. Erika Penala:
L. Erika Penala:
L. Erika Penala:
L. Erika Penala: I just need to reask this question, Brian, Alastair because as I speak
with investors, I think the communication on ebciency and expenses is a big part of
what's holding down the stock. So just to clarify in terms of what Betsy was asking,
she was asking, well, given the restatement and thereby higher fees, shouldn't you
adjust the ebciency ratio range to 54% to 58% because you shouldn't get credit for the
restatement, right? So that's why she was asking that. And I think what Ken was asking
was, everything that Alastair mentioned, the curve, the growth capital markets, it's
hitting this year, right?
And so you're on the low side of the 200 basis point -- of the 200 to 300. And so I
guess the question here is what should we take away in terms of the expense
messaging? Is it sort of what Brian alluded to that the headcount just needs time to
work through and then you'll hit 250 to 300, and we just need to be patient. Is there
more investment spend like you told Mike Mayo that you wanted to front load in a
great revenue year.
Like what exactly do you want your investors to take away in terms of how you're
viewing the expense growth relative to your -- the revenue side because, for example,
for your closest peer at JPMorgan, they grow expenses to $105 billion, no one really
links, right, because of the revenue side. So what is the underlying message for
operating leverage for Bank of America over this year and over the 3 years that is
underpinning that 16% to 18%?
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan: Let's back up to it. We -- as Alistair said, we are driving these
numbers and they have improved on a recast basis by a couple of hundred basis
points, and they'll continue to improve. And so the range will move down to lower
numbers. And when we get into the range, we'll reset the range. But I think we're
focused on the wrong thing. The question is, what are you doing now as opposed to
what you say you're going to do. We have a tendency to actually deliver as opposed to
talk about what we do in the future, and that's what we focus on. So what have we
done?
The ebciency ratio came down a couple of hundred basis points on an apples-to-
apples basis with the parts of the revenue stream that are least ebcient, the wealth
management revenue growing very strong in the capital markets revenue. So when the
consumer bank revenue grows in and Global Banking revenue grows at the ebciency
ratio there at, they produce a lot more pop than wealth management, which has,
obviously, the Qnancial advisory tariffs. So you have to also think of where the revenue
Advertisement

growth is coming from to see the improvement, but we moved to 200 basis points.
We've moved in past years when rates stabilize, we'll move it into the 50s.
As you get the lower ebciency ratio, the operating leverage can be narrow and you still
get a bigger earnings spot. One thing that we've been telling you and that we want to
make sure people understand is our goal is to keep driving all the extra NII to the
bottom line meaning the difference between sort of the core and the repricing because
we owe that to drive the returns up and the rest of it will have more normalized
attributes to it. So we've driven the ebciency down, and we expect to continue to drive
it down. It is all going to be due to headcount because that's 60-plus percent of our
expenses.
We've absorbed invation and everything while we're doing that. The expense growth
Alastair just told you Qrst quarter, 4% with expense increases and base increases and
third-party invation coming through, et cetera. So we're very -- we're very ebciently to
our businesses, and we're very ebcient relatively to our peers, and that will continue to
improve. And that's -- I don't know how to do it. One of the things when I talk to
investors and I actually talked to people own a lot of stock every quarter.
Their view is stay away from -- focus people on the operating leverage in the company
because at the end of the day, we've got to grow expenses at a faster rate, which we
have been doing than a slower rate than revenue -- excuse me, revenue at a faster rate
than expenses for operating leverage. We produced that for our last 5 quarters. We
had 5 years of it leading up to the pandemic. You should expect us to get back on a
streak.
But the reason why they want us to focus on that, the people that own the stock is to
get away from the nominal dollar debate every quarter and get more focused on how
the team is doing a great job of driving the revenue and driving the expense. The
revenue growth slows down because the dynamics outside our company, the expense
growth will slow down.

James Mitchell:
James Mitchell:
James Mitchell:
James Mitchell: Maybe just a question on deposits. We've seen 3 rate cuts in
September. Can you speak to what you're seeing in terms of deposit pricing whether
betas are worse, better or worse than expected? And just also what you're seeing with
respect to client behavior would just be helpful to?
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Okay. First, with respect to our pricing discipline, really when you
talk about pricing, we're most focused on the upper end of the corporate banking,
commercial banking, a very large global banking deposit base where we're passing on
rate cuts essentially the moment that they take place and in full. And so that's why you
see the beta there, obviously quite high. Same thing in the upper end of wealth
management. Consumer, you see much less in the way of pricing coming down
Advertisement

because we have so much in the way of noninterest-bearing and checking and so
much in the way of low interest-bearing. So we feel good about the team's pricing
discipline overall.
In terms -- and you should expect that to continue in Q1, recognizing that the rate cut
was late in Q4. In terms of growth, I think if you were -- to look at Page 7 in the earnings
materials, it sort of tells you the picture. On the bottom right, you can see Global
Banking. That's had a very good period of growth. Not sure that sustains at that sort of
level. But we've had good growth in Global Banking. And most importantly, on the top
right, consumer has begun to turn and is growing. And that's the most powerful engine
for us. Those are the most valuable balances. We've now got 3 quarters of year-over-
year growth.
It's poised to grow, place to accelerate. So that's very important and wealth
management is bottoming here. So we feel good about the mix of deposits changing
in our favor this year. I won't just need to make sure that we keep track of that through
the course of the year, but we're pretty optimistic on that, Jim.
James Mitchell:
James Mitchell:
James Mitchell:
James Mitchell: Right. So I guess when you think about maybe invection
[indiscernible] in deposits growing loan growth still strong. You have an NII target of
5% to 7% for this year. Could we just drill down and look at NII ex markets, it's grown
about 5% over the past 2 quarters. Is that a reasonable growth rate for this year? Or do
rate cuts make that a little more challenging? Just how do we think about the markets
versus ex markets NII dynamic?
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Yes. So markets is going to beneQt from a couple of different
things. First, we obviously invested 10% plus into the Global Markets balance sheet. So
that tends to mean that we're likely to grow NII, okay? Second, a big portion of that
growth has been in loans. They're totally about NII. So that obviously is helpful. Third,
when rates are cut, because markets tends to be liability sensitive that tends to be
good for markets NII, okay. All those things are true. And the only thing, Jim, that I was
just making sure that I pointed out in my comments earlier was we ended up at $15.9
billion.
That is what I would consider to be mostly all core NII. It just happens that we had
about $100 million or so of Global Markets NII that I think will revert back to MMSA
next period. So that's the 1 part that I just feel like is important for us to note, but
otherwise, I think Global Markets NII will grow with the continued investment in loans
and in the business over time.

$100 billion just on ballparking that between repo CP, some of the short-term
wholesale funding institutional CDs that we put out there that are just quietly rolling off
now quarter after quarter after quarter. So that's the sort of number I would use.
Christopher McGratty:
Christopher McGratty:
Christopher McGratty:
Christopher McGratty: Okay. Great. And then just piggybacking on the loan growth
comment. The optimism I heard on the commercial growth. I guess any asset class is
perhaps not as optimistic into '26? And if I missed it on the card expectations with the
proposal, any comments there about either growth or expectations for -- to offset that
would be great.
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Just restate the question one more time for me. Just say it again.
Christopher McGratty:
Christopher McGratty:
Christopher McGratty:
Christopher McGratty: Sure. Expectations for loan growth, anything you're not pushing
on for growth? And then given the President's proposed 10% cap on card yields, any
comments related to that related to your current strategy?
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Okay. So on loans, I don't -- I mean, I'd say we're pushing for loan
growth everywhere we can Qnd good high-quality loan growth. So there is no place that
we're not pushing. We obviously have substantial excess of deposits above our loans.
So we've got a lot of capacity there. We've got a lot of excess capital, we'd like to
continue to deploy if we can Qnd productive uses with our client base. So pushing
everywhere I think commercial has obviously had a good period. Wealth Management
has had a good period, too.
Some of that relates to things like traditional securities-based lending, but some
relates to wealthy people looking to purchase expensive assets, and we're there to help
them with that, obviously. The consumer piece had been quieter last year, maybe
picked up a little more this year. We can see the growth now in a variety of categories.
Interesting to see home equity beginning to grow and right in across time. Mortgage, a
little more activity this past quarter, if you see our originations, so we had more there in
resi mortgage. So we're looking to continue to see pickup in consumer activity broadly.
And again, we're trying to drive more card balances. So that's really important for us.
That remains the front of our strategy.
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan: Chris, on the rate cap, obviously, you're here -- there's a good public

debate going out there on the -- if you have unintended consequences of capping rates
as has been proposed over many years by various components in Congress and stuff
like that. The explanation we've always made sure people understood is that the if you
bring the caps down, you're going to get strict credit, meaning less people will get
credit cards and the balance available to them on those credit cards will also be
restricted. And so you have to balance that against what you're trying to achieve on the
affordability. We're all in for affordability. You all know how we run our consumer
business.
It's the most fair to the consumer, and that's why we get good growth in high customer
scores and those increasing. So we build a product to stop people from going to
payday lenders. It's called Balance Assist. We've had 1 million -- 2.5 million to 2 million
plus consumers have used that product to borrow a short-term loan for $500 or -- up to
$500 for a $5 fee. We have a no-frills credit card with lower rate structure to it, and
we've had [ 700,000 ] clients this year took that card. And so we believe in affordability.
But if you -- with instruments that cap, you will see unintended consequence of that,
and I think that's what you're seeing a debate going on is people are making our points
to the various -- the administration and Congress and others involved.
Operator:

Operator: We'll now move on to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Glenn Schorr:
Glenn Schorr:
Glenn Schorr:
Glenn Schorr: I think you brought up an interesting point getting people to focus on
away from the nominal expense sales. And you obviously mentioned the less ebcient
revenues are growing good from Wealth and Capital Markets revenues. So my
question is in a good backdrop like we're in, good economy, strong economy.
Everybody's got a job, markets are doing well. If you take a step back, and you see
vattish consumer deposits and down [indiscernible] deposits, it's not what maybe you
would have expected. And that's not a you thing. That's an everybody thing. So I'm just
wondering if you could address that, even with 680,000 new checking accounts, like
why do you think we see this sluggishness in deposits?
And do you think we'll see a turn at some point in '26? Because that would help the
operating leverage story as well?
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan: Yes. So I think you have to think about what the consumer, especially
in the -- even the wealthy consumer, they come to us for the transactional accounts
and they come to us, whether they're savings money. And as market alternatives off-
balance sheet alternatives, money market funds, et cetera, ran up in rates, you saw a
fair amount of money move in that, especially in the wealth management business.
What Alastair explained earlier is that's kind of all behind us now the consumer has
been stable and bumping along. The wealth management actually grew in the last part
of the year. And so you're seeing it -- and these have settled into much higher levels
than they were traditionally.
Advertisement

So I think wealth management was maybe $200 billion before the pandemic, maybe
$230 billion, something like that $240 billion maybe, and it's moved to $280 billion type
of level. So you're seeing a lot more cash towards. So on the wealth side, it's people
putting money into the off balance sheet yielding things because, frankly, we don't
need the cash, as Alastair explained on some of the things and the early on the rates
paid in CDs and things like that. And then secondly, it's actually the risk on trade of
when the market. And on the general consumer side, what's happened is that they Qne-
tune some of the higher pieces.
And a lot of the decline in balances that we experienced up until the last -- about a year
ago, most of that decline was driven by wealthy consumers and our consumer
franchise. In other words, the balances for the people had less than $10,000 average
balance before the pandemic or that were multiples of what they were pre-pandemic
and then have been stable for the last few years. But the people who had $50,000,
$100,000, $500,000 and average collective balance is pre-pandemic were down 20%.
And with the percentage of total deposits there that drove it down on a relative basis,
but again, that has stabilized. So we feel good where it's going. It's a lot of leverage.
You have a consumer business, which has a 50% proQt margin round numbers. And so
it contributes to that. And if you go back and look historically, we have gotten that
number down pretty far. And that has the biggest proQt engine in the company is core
to us driving that expense ebciency across the whole place.
Glenn Schorr:
Glenn Schorr:
Glenn Schorr:
Glenn Schorr: Okay. I appreciate that, Brian. Maybe just a little more color on your
comment on the IB pipeline looks good. There's moving parts in the fourth quarter, so I
don't want to overemphasize the revenue environment. But maybe you could talk about
the outlook, it's expected to be a pretty strong year. The underlying conditions are
pretty strong for cap markets activity. So my question is, do you feel like you've made
enough investments to capture more than your fair share, pick up share? And do you
expect as good as the year as I do.
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Well, I mean, I think we feel good about both of those. We feel
good about the deal environment. Brian noted earlier, second half of the year,
investment banking fees were 25% higher than the Qrst half of the year, and that's
largely based on more and more certainty around tax and trade and some of the things
that really matter to and CFOs and Boards of Directors. So we feel good about the
investment banking environment. We feel good about our pipeline. And yes, on the
second question, we feel good about our investments.
So you know this, Glenn, but for the beneQt of everyone, we've expanded our local
banking presence around the United States to improve our client coverage. Today,
we're in 24 different cities. We've got over 200 bankers in a group that really focus on
middle-market clients. We've seen the beneQt of that. We expect to see that continue
as their relationships continue to grow. We're covering newer and emerging companies
in things like technology and health care in a different way, earlier in their life cycle, and
Advertisement

we're covering more clients internationally. So all of those places, we feel like are sorts
of places that we should perform well. So yes, we feel good about that.
And then I'd just say when you look at performance overall. Yes, we're at the top with
some of the very largest transactions. So we feel like the franchise is in good shape.

Operator: We'll now move on to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
Steven Chubak:
Steven Chubak:
Steven Chubak:
Steven Chubak: So wanted to ask Alastair -- so I wanted to ask on the GWIM targets
that you had outlined at Investor Day. You saw some good momentum exiting the year.
You outlined the 30% margin target with accelerating growth expectations on the
organic side, but new recruitment does require some upfront investment. So I just
wanted to understand what gives you conQdence you can deliver both the acceleration
in organic while still driving better operating leverage.
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Yes. So I think if you were to ask Lindsay and Eric, they'd tell you,
and if you ask [indiscernible], they tell you that they enjoy signiQcant competitive
advantage as it relates to covering our clients. So obviously, we're in the wealth
business, but we're also in the banking business. We have high tech and we have high
touch. We are digital, but we're also local, and we offer scale. And then in terms of
prospecting for wealthy families to add net new -- we've got consumer, business
banking, commercial banking, corporate investment banking, all helping that group
working together. So that franchise is one then that can deliver.
And if you were to look at what -- if you were to look at, for example, competitive
attrition this quarter, the lowest we've seen in years. I think the Merrill FA see the value
of our franchise and how they can help their own clients over a long period of time, and
we're picking up the recruiting of experienced advisers. That isn't an enormous part of
our strategy, but it's a training program so that we're training people in wealth
management, Bank of America and Merrill and that is what that's ultimately what we
believe we can just keep driving in order to improve the net new vows.
Steven Chubak:
Steven Chubak:
Steven Chubak:
Steven Chubak: That's great. And then just one ticky-tack question on the tax rate.
First off, thank you for implementing the accounting change. It certainly makes our
lives much easier from a modeling standpoint. I know that it appeared at least in the 8-
K that there was a small stub of tax advantage investments where you didn't adjust the
treatment. So I wanted to just understand if that 20% tax rate is expected to hold going
forward beyond 2026 or if there's any potential for very modest but still a little bit of
upward drift as earnings continue to ramp?
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: For now, I'd use the 20% -- I mean, obviously, hence the guidance
earlier. You're right, there are a small number of deals that don't qualify for the
treatment. Now over time, all of those are going to burn down and burn off. And then in
addition, you've got the question of whether or not some of the tax credit equity deals
will end up expiring after 2027. So I think over a very long period of time, it's possible
Advertisement

that the effective tax rate drifts up. But we'll be able to give you more guidance on that
as we go through the various years.
Operator:
Operator:
Operator:
Operator: We'll now move on to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Gerard Cassidy:
Gerard Cassidy:
Gerard Cassidy:
Gerard Cassidy: Can you guys share with us, as you know, the Genius Act was passed
and there's a lot of talk about stablecoin deposits. I think they're now trying to Qgure
out how to close a loop hole so that the stable coin deposits cannot pay interest. If
they are not -- meaning Congress, if they're not successful in closing that loophole,
what's kind of the impact that you guys are thinking that could happen from this trend
in stablecoin deposits?
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan: So I think I would not -- look, we'll be Qne. We'll have the product. We'll
meet customer demand, whatever may surface. And so I don't worry about it. But the
point we've tried to make, and if you look at some studies, I think, were done by
treasury is that they say you can see upwards of $6 trillion in deposits vow off the
liabilities of a banking system to as the deposits into the stablecoin environment. And
the key of that is to think that the restrictions to be a stablecoin is basically think of it
as a money market mutual fund concept that has to be invested in only deposits,
banking Fed or treasuries in short term.
And so when you think about that, that takes lending capacity out of the system. And
that is the bigger concern that we've all expressed to Congress as they think about
this, is that if you move it outside the system, you'll reduce lending capacity of banks
that particularly hurts small-, medium-sized businesses because they're largely lent to
end consumers by the banking industry where capital markets-oriented companies go
off into the market. So I think in the end of the day at the margin, the industry gets
loaned up.
And if you take out deposits, they're not going to -- they're either not going to be able to
loan or they're going to have to get wholesale funding and that wholesale funding will
come at a cost that will increase the cost of borrowing. And so that's the issue that
people have to struggle about. Do I think it affects the course of history of Bank of
America, no, we'll be competitive and drive it. But I think in the industry overall, I think
it's something that we've expressed concern as an industry, and we continue to make
sure that they see those issues as they are trade groups and others as they work
through the funnel legislation.
What will come out of it? I don't know in terms of adjustments or thoughts about that
and are working on as we speak.
Gerard Cassidy:

growth. Loan growth is picking up according to the H8 data. And as bank investors,
we've learned to always look over our shoulder, but it seems like the worry now is there
aren't many worries out there. Do you guys -- when you look at -- other than the
geopolitical risk, of course, which is always a risk, what do you guys focus on just to
keep an eye on in case something goes off the rails or something?
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan:
Brian Moynihan: Yes, don't be a [indiscernible] there, Gerard. At the end of the day,
think about the structure. We are always doing stress tests that revect a 50% decline in
house prices and market declines and all that kind of stuff and we test ourselves every
quarter. We have trading stresses run every day. And so you're always trying to see, at
the end of the day, whatever conQguration of activities that produce as a result, the
result that's going to reverberate into the global Qnancial system and the U.S. Qnancial
system and the U.S. banking system is going to be the economy, right, in a
recessionary environment, a high unemployment, those types of things.
So what we do is we stress scenarios that produce those characteristics. But really, if
you think about it, the stress test is going from where we are today up to 10% plus
unemployment, house prices are down, as I said, they don't -- the way the methodology
doesn't really allow you to adjust your operating expenses, which we know we would
adjust. And you can see the industry passive stress tests, and that's, I think, 1 of the
most valuable things that came out of the regulation.
And our goal is to get those Qne-tuned a little bit so they don't swing back and forth
depending on who is supplying to test, but the reality is it's a good thing, and we all
support that. So I think that's the way to measure it. Is there [indiscernible] that you can
outline you started rattling off and I could [indiscernible] off, yes.
But you sat there and said last year at this time, those same dimensions were in place
2 years ago, 3 years ago, 4 years ago, but we just don't see what we see differently
than this maybe 3 or 4 years ago is the momentum in the market -- the capital markets
activity in the investment in AI and the consumer spending is 150 basis points higher
than it was back then -- our customer base, the credit quality is -- we're running at 40
basis points level.
That's a level that is among the lowest in the history that we could Qnd in a company
going back 30, 50 years, these are good setups, but we're always worried about what
could happen next as you say, and that's why we did the stress testing. That's why we
have to balance. And effectively, that's why we drive responsible growth. We have a
balance in lending. We're not overlent in any 1 industry. We manage those things. We
make sure that we take the credit risk. We don't have a lot of stored risk that the
industry had leading the Qnancial crisis, meeting CDOs and things like that.
So the industry is in pretty good shape, yet there'll be something that will happen and
we'll all have to adjust to it. Let's just hope it takes us longer the next year to happen.

charge-offs have been particularly low in the last couple of quarters. And Brian, you
just mentioned the 40 basis points being historically low. Wholesale also very low. I'm
just curious your thoughts on whether you think we're at below trend levels of losses
and in what categories? And is there a way to think about what more normalized levels
of losses would be even in an economic environment that remains benign as we have
now.

Alastair Borthwick: Well, you're right, asset quality has performed quite well. You can
see that in consumer. You can see that in commercial. At Investor Day, we gave an idea
of what we thought through the cycle might be. I think we said at the time, 50 to 55
basis points. So you can see right now the last 2 quarters, we were at 47 and 44
overall. So we're obviously happy to see that. We feel like we underwrite the right risk.
We feel like we select the right clients. We feel like we've earned that and it happens to
be a good environment right now. But maybe the 50% to 55% is the right number or
through the cycle.
No change to investment.

Saul Martinez: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And I guess in consumer deposits, you
expressed some optimism that you're seeing an invection there and some
acceleration. Just curious where you think the growth can get to? Do you think we can
get to mid-single-digit types of growth in consumer deposits? And what are some of
the variables that would drive that? Does it depend on additional rate cuts? And just
kind of curious what you think a more normalized level of -- or not on a more
normalized level of growth. But where do you think it could go to as rates come down
and deposit growth starts to materialize?
Alastair Borthwick:

Alastair Borthwick:
Alastair Borthwick: Well, look, Brian did a nice job of sort of setting the historical
context. We've had an enormous pandemic bump followed by normalization back
towards something that would be more just normal for consumers in terms of what
they would have in their checking accounts. That has taken years. But what we're
seeing right now, Saul, is if you look at the checking account balances, for example,
they're up a couple of percent now year-over-year, not 0. So do I think it can go higher
again next year? I believe we do. Historically, we might see consumer deposit growth
at GDP to GDP plus type levels.
Now that would put you in the sort of 4% to 5% type of range. Maybe we don't get all
the way there this year, but we just come off a year where we added 3%. So we're

obviously expecting and hoping for something slightly higher again in 2026 as we
move to something more normal.

Brian Moynihan: Well, thank all of you for joining us. And just in summary, it was a
good quarter and a good year, and I want to thank our team at Bank of America for
producing it. We've laid out at Investor Day, that world-class franchise we have across
all these businesses their performance continues to make good progress in '25, both
on revenue proQtability and returns. The organic growth that I outlined earlier remains
strong. The credit is very stable and very good quality. And we continue to manage
head count and expense as we talked about to drive operating leverage. So thank you.
We look forward to talking to you next quarter.
