Walmart (NYSE: WMT) reported broad-based revenue and proQt increases, with
eCommerce, advertising, and membership fees driving a greater share of operating
income. Management highlighted operational ecciency gains from automation and a
strategic emphasis on global platform scaling and digital expansion. The company

operating income, without disclosing any material change in store margins.
Automation penetration reached critical mass in distribution and fulQllment,
enabling lower labor costs and enhanced inventory visibility.

volatility, but management expressed conQdence in exceeding targets based on
recent multi-year outperformance.

free cash vow and a multi-year capital framework, signaling balance sheet strength

John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner: I'd like to start by saying thank you to our associates around the world in
helping us deliver another year of strong growth. Across markets, our teams continue
to demonstrate the power of omnichannel model Since the year began, I've visited
great stores and clubs in The US, Canada, and Mexico. The automation of our supply
chain is on track, We're gaining market share. And we have momentum in growth areas
like marketplace, advertising, and membership. Looking at our results for the quarter,
revenue was up 4.9% in constant currency, including growth in e commerce of 24%.
Adjusted operating income grew even faster at 10.5%. All three segments grew proQts
faster than sales for the quarter.
And we're doing a great job of managing inventory that's so important in running our
business day to day. We ended the quarter with inventory up 2.6% or about half the rate
of sales growth. Sales were strong across each segment of the business. And this
includes sales of general merchandise, which grew on a global base and was up low
single digits for Walmart US led by fashion. Fashion was a bright spot for us both in
store and online. Driving a healthier mix of sales growth in our business is important to
the strategy overall so I'm pleased with the trends we're seeing. Across our customer
base, spending continues to be resilient.
In The US, we see the customer as choiceful in their spending, Again, this quarter, the
majority of our share gains came from households making more than $100,000. For
households earning below $50,000, we continue to see that wallets are stretched. And

in some cases, people are managing spending paycheck to paycheck. That said, even
these households are emphasizing convenience nearly as much as price. Stepping
back, when I look at the enterprise today, it's a portfolio of businesses anchored in
growth. Especially our digital channels, with an emphasis on having inventory close to
the customer to maximize our delivery speed. Our associates have made this vision a
reality and I couldn't be prouder of them.
They've been open to change, learn new skills, and they pushed us to keep the
customer and the member at the center of everything we do. Ultimately, what matters
is how we show up for our customers and members. Did we serve their needs better
today than we did yesterday? If so, we did our job. And how we approach getting better
every day is what's important to me. We do that by living our purpose and values. That
won't change. Our mission help people save money and live better is as true today as
it's ever been. It guides the strategy we've outlined, and that strategy is clear. We're
executing on it at a high level.
And this includes the allocation of capital, which remains consistent with how we've
described it as a percentage of sales. We look at capital spending through the lens of
return on investment. Every dollar we spend has to compete for the highest return.
Walmart Inc. is widely known for value on a broad assortment of items and for being a
company that people trust. And thanks to how we leverage our assets for a truly
omnichannel experience we're now known for ultra fast delivery times and providing
convenience. The investments we've made in technology and supply chain help us
deliver items even faster. They're paying off.
Here in The US, customers using fast delivery, that's delivery in under three hours, grew
more than 60% for the year. We know that customers and members from around the
world are more alike than they are different. They love great quality products, value for
their money, and more often, they're turning to Walmart Inc. for speed of delivery on a
broad assortment. And being people led and tech powered helps our associates to Qnd
better ways to serve customers and members with our growing assortment faster
delivery speeds, and experiences they love. The way we're using technology and AI is
helping us create great customer solutions reduce friction, simplify decision making,
and pinpoint where our inventory is.
All while maintaining the trust we've earned from our customers and members. And we
aren't just embracing the tools that are changing the way people shop, We're creating
them. We're enhancing our shopping assistance like Sparky and building new
experiences with partners like OpenAI and Alphabet. That are shaping the future of
AgenTek commerce. Looking more closely at Sparky, we're seeing good momentum.
Customer engagement is up, and the customers who use Sparky have an average
order value that's about 35% higher than non Sparky customers. And I love how Sparky
perfectly Qts within our omnichannel strategy. It connects digital intent to fulQllment
through forward deployed inventory and 1,500,000 associates here in The US.

When Sparky builds a basket, we execute it through fast delivery, pickup, or in store,
turning AI engagement into immediate physical outcomes. in store, And as we expand
Sparky across experiences like voice, and through services. We expect continued
acceleration in customer adoption and the impact on commerce. We've started with
Sparky here in The US, but we know that winning in a connected world means we need
to deliver consistent experiences across markets. And to do that, need to focus on
technology platforms that are built for a global business. The idea of build once scale
globally makes us faster, lowers cost, and ensures consistency.
And we'll use AI to layer on top of existing platforms getting better leverage out of the
assets we already own. This platform centric approach helps us scale innovation
consistently and reduce capital intensity. As I close, I'll say the pace of change in retail
is accelerating. It's exciting. For Walmart Inc., the future is fast, convenient, and
personalized. And I'm challenging our teams to move even faster as the opportunities
with AI become broader and deeper. I feel great about our future. Over the past several
weeks, I've talked with associates in Mexico, Canada, and across a number of cities
here in The US, and I love what I'm seeing.
The enthusiasm, the passion, the execution, all the things that make Walmart Inc. a
great place to shop and a great place to build a career they've been on display. And I
can't wait to get out to more markets in the coming weeks. I'm so grateful for the
opportunity to lead a business that has momentum built on a strong foundation and
with a deeply experienced leadership team. And mostly, I'm excited about what's to
come and the plans we have to grow the business as we look ahead. And, John David,
I'll turn it over to you.

John David Rainey: I also want to thank all of our associates for helping us deliver
these results. If there's one thing I want you to take away from this call, it's that our
teams are executing well, and our business model is delivering strong growth
incremental proQts. Even in the context of the highly dynamic operating conditions we
and the rest of the retail industry are experiencing. We Qnished the year strong with a
quarter of broad based share gains continued e commerce momentum, and adjusted
operating income growing at 10 and a half percent in constant currency. Which is over
twice the rate of sales growth. The advantages of our omnichannel model and
diversiQed proQt streams are increasingly clear.
For the full year, we grew the top line by approximately 5% in constant currency. Adding
$35,000,000,000 in revenue. With sales exceeding $700,000,000,000 for the Qrst time.
And we grew adjusted operating income 5.4%. Even with a 300 basis point headwind
from increased claims expenses and navigating a bumpy tariff environment. This was
the third consecutive year that we grew proQts at a faster rate than sales growth. We're
playing offense by reinforcing our customer and member value proposition evolving
our model, and delivering on our Qnancial framework. Our strategy is working. And

we're excited about the opportunities ahead. For the fourth quarter, consolidated
revenue in constant currency increased nearly 5%. With Walmart U. S. Comp sales up
4.6%.
E commerce sales were strong across markets. With growth up 24%. We're using our
unique assets, stores and clubs, DCs and FCs, and last mile delivery networks to get
orders to customers faster and more ecciently. Remove friction from the experience,
and accelerate our sales momentum. In Walmart US, ecommerce sales grew 27%, with
35% of store fulQlled orders delivered in under three hours. In China, e commerce grew
28% and represented more than 50% of the sales mix in that market. Flipkart is
delivering orders in less than Qfteen minutes across more than 30 cities in India. And
Sam's Club US doubled their growth in club fulQlled delivery sales.
The increase in fourth quarter operating income was led by more than 26% growth in
international revecting improved e commerce economics as well as lapping last year's
strategic investments. And nearly 7% growth in Walmart US. Several factors
contributed to our operating proQt growth. First, business mix. As e commerce drives
the majority of our sales growth, we're improving e commerce economics with
increased contributions from business mix most notably in higher margin areas like
advertising and membership fees. Our advertising businesses globally increased 37%,
including an acceleration in Walmart Connect in The US up 41%. Importantly, we
lapped the acquisition of Visio in December, so their performance will now be in our
base.
Consolidated membership income increased more than 15% revecting strength in
Sam's Club in China which grew over 35%. In The US, Walmart Plus membership
income was strong, up double digits, as our core offering as well as newer beneQts like
our One Pay Cash Rewards credit card continue to resonate with members. Sam's Club
U. S. Membership income grew more than 6% as members gravitate toward the
omnichannel capabilities Sam's offers. Notably the combination of advertising income
and membership fees represented nearly one third of our operating income this
quarter. Second is inventory management. Inventory increased 2.6% in constant
currency. Or approximately half the rate of sales growth for the full year.
With our growing 3P marketplace, we can better balance owned and third party
assortment, minimize markdowns, and improve our working capital. Inventory
ecciency is also enabled by the tech AI and automation in our stores, clubs, and
supply chain. In Walmart US, approximately 60% of stores are receiving some freight
from automated distribution and approximately 50% of e commerce fulQllment center
volume is automated. This enables better visibility into what inventory we own and
inventory we can access, and also improved our labor productivity. we're increasingly
leveraging stores, With the proximity so close to customers, as digital fulQllment nodes
to move inventory faster and more ecciently than ever before.
When you simplify our model, inventory and labor, are our two largest costs.

Technology enabled productivity beneQts are critical to our ability to grow our core
omni business at lower marginal cost. We're extending these platform beneQts from
the Walmart US to Sam's US and we're at the early stages of deploying automation
across our supply chain in select international markets. And third, merchandise
category mix. This is an exciting one to call out as it's been many years in the making,
particularly in Walmart US. As we lean into lower prices through rollbacks in EDLP and
grocery categories, we're helping customers unlock purchasing power for general
merchandise. We've worked hard to mitigate grocery invation.
As tariff related costs lifted prices across many categories. We're seeing share gains
in GM and in fashion We've had several quarters in a row of mid single digit sales
growth. Importantly, the strategies that drove our results throughout FY '26 are
consistent with what we expect to support our Qnancial framework in FY '27. First, we
have strong momentum across our businesses. Most notably in digital. E commerce
sales grew nearly 25% this year, and exceeded a $150,000,000,000 for the Qrst time.
With Q4 representing 23% of sales mix. This is up 550 basis points from just two years
ago. This sets us up uniquely well to serve customers however they want to shop with
us.
Particularly as they adopt Agintic Commerce solutions. Second we've demonstrated
the durability of our model especially in complex operating conditions. We're realizing
the beneQts of our diversiQed growth oriented global portfolio. This has enabled us to
grow underlying proQts meaningfully faster than sales for each of the past three years.
Our advertising businesses globally were up 46% this year to $6,400,000,000 And
membership fees exceeded $4,300,000,000 And many of these initiatives are early in
their maturity curve. We have a combination of proQt drivers, including automation
related inventory and labor productivity, favorable business mix, and continued
expense discipline. To support continued investment and to drive faster operating
income growth.
And third, to orient us to move faster at lower cost, we're now aligned globally to
leverage common platforms in tech, AI and digital businesses. We believe this will
result in our growth continuing to come at a much lower marginal cost than what it has
historically. Now I'll discuss guidance. Full year constant currency sales are expected
to grow between 3.54.5%. And operating income is expected to grow between 68%.
With EPS in the range of $2.75 to $2.85. Sales guidance revects a continuation of
underlying business drivers and share gains, It considers our efforts to mitigate food
price invation and the headwinds on sales growth from maximum fair pricing
legislation in pharmacy.
And we expect e commerce will continue to be the primary driver of growth with
modest increases from store and club sales across the enterprise. Operating income
guidance revects a higher level of conQdence relative to prior year's original guidance
that we can deliver growth in the upper half of the range depicted in our framework.
Our goal is to outperform this guidance. But we believe it's prudent to start the year
with a level of conservatism given the backdrop is still somewhat unstable. We're

assuming continued margin expansion driven by favorable business mix, automation
beneQts and productivity, and less headwinds from merchandise category mix. The
business continues to generate strong cash vow.
With operating cash vow of $42,000,000,000 and growth in free cash vow of 18% in FY
2026. This provides vexibility to reinvest in the business while at the same time
returning signiQcant capital to shareholders. Given our conQdence in the ability to
continue to generate strong cash vows, and consistency in our multiyear capital
investment plans, our board authorized a $30,000,000,000 share repurchase program
our largest to date. For f y '27, we expect capital expenditure levels to be approximately
three and a half percent of sales. We're hitting the peak of annual spending levels on
supply chain automation and store remodels.
We're moving quickly on these projects as we see beneQts to customer experience,
business performance, and Qnancial returns from these investments. Investments in AI
are incorporated into our assumptions for capital spend. And as you've seen from the
announcements we've made, we're approaching AI development through partnerships.
This lets tech companies do what they do best, develop innovative technology. And it
provides us clarity to do what we do best: to translate the best of tech to retail
experiences that create value for our customers and members and our enterprise. In
Q1 we expect constant currency growth in sales of 3.5% to 4.5%. And operating
income of 4% to 6%.
With EPS of $0.63 to $0.65 Q1 operating income growth is expected to be lower than
any other quarter in FY 'twenty seven. Due in part to timing of expenses, and the year
over year tariff impacts that started in last year's second quarter. Importantly, our Qrst
half results are expected to be in the range of our full year guide. Recall also that we
guide on a constant currency basis. If current exchange rates were to stay where they
are now, we would expect an approximate 150 basis point beneQt to reported sales
growth. And an approximate 200 basis point beneQt to operating income growth in Q1.
For the full year, we would expect an approximate 70 basis point beneQt to sales and
an approximate 120 basis point beneQt to OI. With that, we're ready to take your
questions. Thank you.

Simeon Gutman:
Simeon Gutman:
Simeon Gutman:
Simeon Gutman: And it's rapidly reshaping e commerce as we speak. Realize a lot is
still, to be determined. I wanna ask how you're thinking about Qrst customer tracc
vows and loyalty. Related to AgenTic, and second, advertising and monetization.
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner: Yeah. Good morning, Simeon. Thanks for the question. So Qrst, I just
want to say thanks to our associates for a great quarter. They've been executing at a
very consistent level with a clear strategy that's omni And as it relates to your question,
AgenTic is deQnitely a part of the omni strategy. I mean, our omni strategy, what we've
been saying for a long time and building to is the ability to deliver what customers
want, when they want it, and how they want it. And vexibility that we've built on the
backside of this, which includes our fulQllment centers, our distribution centers, our
stores, forward deployed inventory, are all parts of the solution to deliver.
What AgenTic is doing for us, and we can talk about this in a couple ways, But I'll talk
about Sparky Qrst with our own agentic agent Sparky is going to be and is and is vastly
becoming as it learns new skills. A way that we can understand customer intent better
than when they've been able to understand it before. Generate solutions for them, and
then deliver with speed. You heard earlier that our fast delivery was up 60% year on
year. Walmart's getting faster. Sam's Club is getting faster. We're able to scale these
platforms to international markets. So our ability to understand consumer customer
intent generate them solutions and deliver quickly is really exciting.
It's been the quarter what we saw is that customers who engage with Sparky, we saw
an average order volume order value, I should say, about 35% higher than the
customers who weren't using it. What's also exciting is we had a really high number of
customers who are now engaging with Sparky quarter over quarter, but a lot to come
here. AgenTek Commerce is gonna be great for our customers. It's also gonna be great
Agentic AI will be great for our associates because it helps them focus on the things
that are most important. And, Dave, do you want anything on Sparky in the quarter?
Simeon Gutman:
Simeon Gutman:
Simeon Gutman:
Simeon Gutman: Absolutely. Thanks, John. And good morning, Simeon.
Dave Gagina:
Dave Gagina:
Dave Gagina:
Dave Gagina: As John noted, AI is increasingly embedded across Walmart. It's
strengthening our operations. It's improving associate productivity. And it's enhancing
the customer experience. And that's really coming to life with Sparky. Sparky is
essentially helping us evolve from traditional search to intent driven commerce. And as
John noted, we're seeing strong engagement, roughly half of our app users have used
Sparky. And when they use Sparky, it drives them to build bigger baskets. And John
mentioned the 35% higher average order value. And what that's telling us is that it's it's
helping customers convert with greater conQdence. And I want to note that it is still
early in this space and we're continuing to add capabilities.
More personalization, deeper contextual understanding, We're building execution
capabilities. And I'm excited about the future for Sparky. And then for this group in
particular, from an economic standpoint, better discovery and higher conversion
Advertisement

translates into bigger baskets and greater frequency. So simply put, Sparky is helping
customers Qnd the things they need, they want, and they love. And it's strengthening
our digital unit economics as it scales.
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner: So Simeon, second part of your question then, you asked about
advertising as well. We had a really good quarter in advertising, up 37% around the
world, while Walmart Connect in The United States was up 41%, which is a very strong
quarter. So how this will work with Agenda Commerce, I think we're all learning as we
go, and we'll Qgure that out. But what we do know and is clearly happened in the
quarter, is our ability to connect suppliers and sellers with a group of customers
groups of customers who are interested in their products is working, and our capability
to do that is getting stronger.

Operator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please
proceed with your question. Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my
question. Last year was obviously marked by a number of unanticipated costs that
impacted Walmart's proQtability, such as tariffs, the liability expense, and others, how
did you factor that there could be other unknowns into your outlook this year, what
could those be? And if they do not occur, how would you frame or quantify the
potential upside of reinvestment And along those lines, how would you quantify the
degree that you've embedded in your outlook for this year. Thank you so much.
Michael, this is John David. I'll I'll take that.
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey: Let me let me give a little bit of context to our full year guidance,
which I think will speak to your question. If you if you rewind and you look back over
the last three years, prior to this one, we've increased our guidance effectively
increased our guidance if you adjust for the Visio acquisition each of those three
years. And each of those years, we've outperformed that guidance. In some cases,
with operating income by several 100 basis points. And in fact, if you were to adjust for
claims being somewhat anomalous last year, have the same performance in this most
recent year.
So as we sit here one month into this new Qscal year, very much like in past years,
we're taking a measured approach with the outlook. There's nothing that we've seen
among consumer behavior or KPIs, macroeconomic KPIs, that would make us be any
more cautious than what we have been, but I think it's prudent to be somewhat
balanced. We are know, I think overall constructive on the economy, but there are
certainly indicators out there, whether it be a hiring recession or maybe subdued
consumer sentiment, student loan delinquencies, things like that, that make you wanna
be more balanced as you sit here at this point in time.
And we've been very fortunate to be able to take a very long term perspective with the
way that we manage this business. To do things that are best for customers. And I
would argue that translated into what's best for shareholders as well. So said maybe
slightly differently, we want to maintain maximum vexibility as we sit here at this point
Advertisement

in the year. And it's it's no different than the posture that we took in prior years. So the
guidance that we've given, which at the upper end of operating income is 8% on a
currency neutral basis, over 9% on a reported basis. We're excited about it. We see the
momentum in our business.
Each year has gotten better than the last, and we've outperformed that. And we would
certainly expect to do that this year as well. But I think given that we are as large as we
are and so tied to consumer health and the economy, we want to maintain maximum
and not get out ahead of ourselves at this point in the year.

proceed with your question. Hi, thanks. I wanted to
Greg Melich:
Greg Melich:
Greg Melich:
Greg Melich: get a little deeper into disinvation. I think it was up a little over 1% this
quarter and maybe that was down a little bit sequentially. Can you just help us
understand in your guide what you're expecting from invation or particularly invation
especially with drug prices coming down?
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey: Sure, Greg. This is John David again. I'm happy to take that. The
most recent quarter, we had like for like invation that was trending a little bit above 1%.
That breaks down into food invation being a little bit less than that. GM invation being
a little bit more than that. That's generally what our outlook is for the next quarter and
the balance of the year. There are some pressures. You mentioned one. The maximum
fair pricing, legislation around drugs we expect to contribute to about a 100 basis point
headwind for the full year. Within the most recent quarter, having only one month of
that is about 30 basis points.
So the health and wellness business continues to do really well and have strong
comps, but that's a that's a headwind that it will face for the year. Generally speaking,
we would expect the price levels to, you know, somewhat be in the range that they are
right now. We're excited about the some of the commentaries that we've heard from
suppliers focusing on lower prices, but that plays to our value proposition. Everyday
low prices is what we stand for. We've seen as we've leaned into these lower prices
that consumers have responded. And we've continued to gain share among all income
demographics, I might point out.
Notably probably skewed more towards the higher income demographic but we're
gonna continue to play offense.

Can you maybe talk

Katharine McShane:
Katharine McShane: to what you're expecting to be that contribution from mix And
also, can you go into a little bit more detail about the inventory management
enhancements you need? Is it all from automation, or are there other initiatives here?
And how does this get going across? The regions? Hey, Kate. It's John. Let me start
with inventory.
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner: And then I'll turn it over to John David. We'll talk about mix together. On
inventory, I would say there are a number of factors that have helped us manage
inventory the way we're managing. I'm really proud that the team this is a great team
who dealt with a lot of uncertainty the last twelve months and really the last few years
to manage inventory. Half the rate of sales growth is an impressive number. There are
a number of technologies we're using to manage inventory, more effectively today than
we were in years past. Part of that is automation. We have a number of locations now
that are receiving the majority of their goods. From automated facilities.
We have a couple thousand that are getting some kind of automation and make expect
that to grow over the course of the year. We had a couple of our regional distribution
centers, and I believe you've been in the in one of these before. That retired the old
conveyor belt system that we ran on top of for about twenty years. Some of those
buildings up to thirty years. So the conversion is underway. We're really pleased with
the capital investments and the returns we're getting on those. In the supply chain,
those investments probably peak this year and next year. So automation is a part of it,
but also in store.
Our associates are over a million associates just in The US alone have handheld
devices, and they're using computer vision. To map our inventory to know what we
have, to know exactly where it is, and know how it's deployable. So that when a
customer places an order, shops at the counter, wants pickup, the inventory, we can
believe, conQdently is there and it's available. So there's really a system from end to
end that the entire team has been working on to get to the point where we are today.
The third thing I'd say is the team's done a really nice job managing seasonal inventory
buys. Fashion has been stronger. Sell throughs have been stronger.
We've done a great job in last few quarters with holiday. If anything, I'd say in the fourth
quarter, we may have bought a bit light in certain categories. We had a strong quarter,
as we mentioned, in general merchandise and fashion, but there were categories that if
you could rewind the tape, we probably would have bought even more aggressive. But
the good thing about that is we enter this Qrst quarter, we're We have momentum. And
so I think we're in a good spot in terms of mix. And I'll turn it over to John David to talk
about overall business mix.
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey: Yeah. Kate, let me before I talk about the coming year, I think it's
Advertisement

important to talk about some of the improvement that we had in the fourth quarter. A
lot of what John talked about in terms of the improvements we've made in our supply
chain translate into improved operational beneQts like fewer fresh throwaways, better
inventory management, things like that, fewer markdowns. And so we saw a beneQt of
that. In the fourth quarter. We'd expect a continued beneQt of that going into the next
year. If I if I break down the p and l, generally speaking, we're expecting gross proQt to
improve next year. We're also expecting some leverage in s g and a.
And I should pause here for a second. We leveraged in s g and a for the fourth quarter
this fourth quarter, and that's the Qrst time in a while. We're excited about that because
you all are starting to see some of the beneQts of this supply chain automation and
productivity beneQts that we've been implementing for years, and that's translating into
improved Qnancial performance. But to the heart of your question about business mix,
we would continue to expect an improvement to gross proQt related to business mix
going into next year. I noted, in my prepared remarks, fully a third of our proQt in the
most recent quarter was related to advertising and membership income.
And so what we're excited about that. We expect a continuation of those types of
beneQts. And you overlay on that the other parts of the business that we don't talk
quite as much about, but fulQllment services, marketplace, which are all doing really
well, translates into the improved economics that we're expecting in the coming year.

Operator:
Operator:
Operator:
Operator: a follow-up question on that. Can you talk about the progression of
marketplace growth and fulQllment services how are you expecting the proQtability of
this alternate proQt pool to progress from last year? And then as we look forward over
the next couple of years, And then more of a near term question, there's a lot of hope
that The U. S. Consumer will beneQt from signiQcant tax stimulus this year. Your stores
tend to be on the leading edge because you see those consumers cashing those
checks Curious if you if you've seen anything so far and how those funds are being
spent. Thanks so much.
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey: Chris, I'll start with that, and others may wanna jump in after my
comments. Marketplace, I would characterize as an area of ongoing investment. We
haven't talked about when we expect that by itself to achieve proQtability. This is
something that as you think about the two legs of growth or proQtability, we wanna
lean a lot more into growth right now. We think that's what's best for our business. If
you just look at the most recent quarter, there are many categories, cook and dine,
fashion, home decor. That all grew north of 40%. On our marketplace. That's exactly
what we wanna see.
Advertisement

And we don't wanna overly Qxate on one aspect of our of our ecosystem of services
that we provide to try to achieve proQtability there. So we think investment is the best
opportunity there. Walmart fulQllment services today has 52% of our sellers. Take
advantage of that. And I've you've heard me say this before, Chris, but I think if you're
selling on Walmart and not using Walmart fulQllment services, you're almost using us
in the wrong way. It is too good of a service. We continue to see that penetration
increase and continue to see the teams perform in that area for our sellers.
So, you know, those would be a couple areas that I think are we'd highlight for the
coming year. As it pertains to the increase in tax refunds, We certainly have some of
that in our guidance. We have to make assumptions about how much of that will be
saved versus spent. And of what is spent, how much goes into the Qrst quarter versus
later quarters in the year. You know, it remains to be seen. You are correct in to
suggest that we tend to be very levered to that when we see those move up or down, it
impacts our business. But we our guidance does assume an increase in tax refunds
this year.

really encouraging and impressive. What do you see ahead in terms of how the
business model Continues to evolve and densiQcation. And as we think more broadly

particularly as you see so much interaction with Sparky and have a lot of
Oliver Chen:
Oliver Chen:
Oliver Chen:
Oliver Chen: veracity, volume, and velocity of data. Thank you.
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner: Hey, Oliver. Great question that John David was just alluding to many
parts of what we built to try to serve customers any way they want to be served, where
they want to be served, how they want to be served. And that's really the center of what
we'd call the omni strategy. This would include our stores, our e commerce business
that's pure fulQllment. We have our stores that are delivering. We have a mix of all the
above. It's really all designed about channel vexibility.
What we've been saying for a few years is that channel vexibility has been, and again in
this quarter, has helped us meet new customers, serve new customers, grow with
customers that we haven't been transacting with in the past. So it's really encouraging.
But all these pieces have to work together in order for this all to come to the point that
we can have results like we had in the quarter.
So the best way to say it is if you look at Walmart on the top line, and you look at
Walmart on the bottom line, those are those are where I would encourage you to just
hold us accountable, because we have a great team here with a lot of experience that
can manage the pieces in the middle, ultimately driving it faster delivery speeds and
more intuitive experiences so that customers trust us to be a great place for a great
Advertisement

assortment and great prices. Delivered the way that they want it to be delivered. And
what we're seeing with Sparky and again, it's early days, with agent of commerce being
live in the site.
But the quarter was really encouraging. We had a lot of growth from Q4 over Q3. A lot
of engagement. Dave mentioned earlier about half of our customers did engage with
Sparky. And when they do engage with Sparky, we see better order value We had a 27%
growth rate in ecommerce in the fourth quarter, which is a big quarter for Walmart US,
24% globally. Sparky is only live in The US, but we have hope and ambition that quickly
we can expand these platforms into other markets, and I think that will be accretive in
those markets.
But what Sparky can do is it can help understand really clearly what it is that you're
trying to accomplish in your life, whether that's a birthday party or camping trip or
planning meals for the week or just planning dinner for this evening, and then we can
generate you great, unique solutions real time if we need to. Or by knowing you a bit
better than we did in the past, we can help suggest things to you are more in line with
your own personal preferences.
So all this put together we believe, is a great way for customers to build a trust that
Walmart will save them time while shopping save them time in the transaction, but
also save them time in delivery. A large number of our orders now we're really proud of
are now happening in less than half an hour. We're We're averaging under an hour. Our
express delivery when customers choose that. Then as we mentioned earlier, for our
express delivery or total fast delivery, which under three hours grew 60% year on year.
So when you put it all together, we're conQdent in the strategy. We like the assets that
we have in place.
Continue to invest our capital in a disciplined way. That provides returns but ultimately
drives great customer experiences over the long term.

accelerating there? And where do you feel your know, still kind of underpenetrated or

John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey: Kelly, this is John David. I'll I'll make an attempt at that. In terms of
what to expect on advertising, you know, the you're right in terms of what you're
applying. You get to a law of large number where it gets more challenging to enjoy
those same growth rates. But in terms of overall progress, that we're making with
advertising, I don't I really don't see that slowing down. Some of the areas that we've
really expanded in are areas like our marketplace business where we folk we're we're
seeing more of the growth come from that part of the business versus some of the
Qrst party brands The other thing I'll point out is the Visio acquisition.
We saw triple digit growth in advertising with our Visio business in the quarter. We've
talked a lot about this. This is exciting because it gives us yet another channel to, to
market to our customers. And I feel like that's really just getting started. Obviously, the
base there is not as large as the overall US business, but has a whole lot of runway.
As we've talked about in the past, and I know you're very familiar with, Kelly, you know,
if you if you measure us advertising as a percent of, like, the addressable market or our
GMV, We still have a long ways to go here to get in the neighborhood of some of the
best in class competitors here. And so we feel like we can improve our own advertising
capabilities while doing it on a growing base, which gives us a lot of runway into the
future.
John Furner:

John Furner:
John Furner: Kelly, you mentioned the team. I'm really proud of the promotions here.
At Walmart. Dave Gagina, who spent what most of his career in ecommerce and
logistics, Chris in businesses all around the world, and Latrice Watkins, twenty seven
years, and majority of that in merchandising. They're going to do a great job, and they
have a lot of experience. There was a structure change that we made in January, which
is also really important. And I think that signals conQdence that the capabilities we
have built in The US are exportable to other markets, and we can work with our other
markets to accelerate these platforms to grow.
And so that change was set to layer included the marketplace, Visio, advertisements,
our data services, and Walmart plus being moved from inside Walmart U. To an
enterprise role where we can build once build these platforms once, scale them
globally. So we're optimistic that what Seth has done here in The US with his team can
accelerate growth in other markets additionally. So John David said it well. This is a big
business that's growing, but our share is relatively low. Compared to what it could be in
terms of the addressable market. And we are really excited about the opportunity for
Seth and his team to work across the entire enterprise.

forward? And what the impact to margins will be as a result, given we know that the
margins are better in stores versus e commerce? Thanks so much.
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner: Hey, Corey. It's John, and, Dave, and I'll I'll take this one together. You
know, as you step back and just think about this the omni strategy the role of stores,
the role of the app and how they work together, it's just important to remember that
stores are a huge part of the solution to deliver the customer experiences that the
customers are looking for. Having inventory, and I'll talk about The US and globally just
here in a second, Having The US with 5,200 locations between Walmart and Sam's
where inventory is forward deployed is really helpful.
And that's great for a customer who wants to shop in a store, pick up at the curb, or
have delivery and do it in a very fast way. We have strength in international markets as
well, places like China has had record deliveries from the clouds in Sam's Club for the
season in Chinese New Year. That's also true in other markets in Mexican Canada
where I visited in the last few months. So stores are a really important part of it. How a
customer wants to shop, that is completely up to the customer. It's pretty typical that
you'd see in the holiday front type frame people leaning on delivery more.
We had really great experiences and great results in November with Thanksgiving.
More and more customers chose to have their Thanksgiving meal delivered. And then
this recent ice storm we had in The United States, we also saw a signiQcant number of
customers looking for delivery services much higher than the year before. So whether
people are shopping at the counter, shopping at the curb, they're shopping in the store,
we wanna be there for all of them.
In terms of the mix and the impact of the p and l, getting to where we were last year
with ecommerce moving to proQtability, the growth of advertisement, the growth of the
other services, We like the way our P and L is set up in terms of providing mix over
time. Again, we'll manage that really well. We have a great team of people who do that.
So again, excited about the top line growth. Excited that our operating income grew
faster than our than our sales in all three segments. And I'm also very conQdent in the
guidance that John David talked about. So do you wanna talk about remodels and
investments in stores?
Dave Gagina:
Dave Gagina:
Dave Gagina:
Dave Gagina: Yeah. Absolutely. As John mentioned, you know, we're focused on
serving customers how, where, and when they wanna shop across stores, pickup, and
delivery. And our ecommerce growth of 27% you know, is leveraging our physical
footprint. So this is an interconnected system. So we are making further investments
in our store network as a result in that physical footprint. Over the past twelve months,
we've opened 12 new stores, and we've remodeled 674 stores. Our investments in both
of those areas are outperforming plan, and I think that just reinforces the strength in
the omnichannel model.

accelerating Competition in e com, you know, certainly seems to be intense. You
maybe just touch on, you know, what Walmart needs to be vigilant on, to sustain share
momentum. And does this impact at all the near term proQt path for the business?
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey: This is John David. I'll start with the e comm proQtability. Ed, we've
reached a point where we don't even really talk about this internally anymore. We've far
surpassed the breakeven level. We were proQtable in each of the four quarters in The
US segment, and the momentum is only up from here. We've been enjoying roughly
double digit incremental margins in ecommerce. We don't expect that to change. Feel
really good about the plan going forward. And as you know, the nature of this business
is you build a large digital platform. And the marginal cost of growth is very low. You
don't have to continue to build that platform to achieve the next percentage point of
growth.
And so we're enjoying the scale economics that come from a digital business. That's
not going to change. And getting to the second part of your question, we're seeing that
is resonating with our customer member base. We, we continue to gain share. And I
think a big part of that is convenience. It is the fact that we can serve 95% of America
in three hours. There are very few people that can do that. And as John and Dave
noted, in some cases, less than minutes. But it's not just convenience. I'll I'll I'll point
you to fashion as an example. Like, we've had several consecutive quarters now of
fashion growth in the mid single digits.
I'd argue fashion is not really a convenience item. It shows that our broader
assortment is appealing to a much larger customer base And they're and they're
coming to Walmart in many cases, some of them for the Qrst time. And they're they're
enjoying an experience that makes them want to come back.
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner: Yeah. These platforms that we've put together, they work at Walmart US.
They work in other businesses. Sam's Club is an example. Obviously, a category or a
channel that's focused on curation and quality. But, Latrice, maybe you comment on
the experience your members are having with the delivery platform as we have scaled
the platform for Walmart US exams?
Kelly Bania:

Latrice Watkins:
Latrice Watkins: this is what I love. I love to talk about how we give members access
to products, and you've said it however they want to shop with us. So a couple of
things are happening at Sam's Club. We are leveraging the platform that is what we've
created as part of Walmart. And what we're seeing from members who choose to shop
with us from home on our app is that 60% of our members can get delivery in three
hours. So we're growing that. We're we won't stop there at the 60%. We are growing our
ability to give members their items quickly. For members who want to come in club,
they love Scan and Go.
So scan and go is an is a seamless way for members to get the items they want, get
checked out, use our exit arches, have a frictionless experience fast. So in the spirit of
what members want, and what they need, they want items, and they wanna get through
our, clubs quickly. And Scan and Go gives them the opportunity to do that. And delivery
from club gives them the speed that they want.

Charles Grom:
Charles Grom:
Charles Grom:
Charles Grom: Could you talk about the health of The U. S. Consumer across income
cohorts at this point in time? Any surprises this past holiday season? And looking
ahead, when you look at the baskets of GLP one users, how is their shopping behavior
changed in terms of frequency and basket size? And I guess how does that invuence
your planning of inventory in the coming quarters and years?
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner: Hey, Chuck. In the earlier comments, we talked about the consumer in
The US. We had a lot of growth with customers who are income bracket of 100,000 or
above. That's pretty consistent with the last few quarters and the way we've talked
about it. So I don't think there's any big change. I think with the way we describe our
customers is very thoughtful. They're choiceful. And the lower income segment, 50,000
and below, we did see, of course, Leslie mentioned, some stress In many cases, we
see people living paycheck to paycheck.
In the fourth quarter speciQcally, there was some sales impact early on that was driven
by beneQts during the government shutdown that affected Walmart US in The United
States. The most part, Walmart US, that recovered as the quarter went on. There
seems to be some impact to Sam's over time. On the pharmacy business, the biggest
change that'd be notable would be the NFP MFP pricing changes on branded drugs.
The remaining categories have been pretty consistent over time, and we did provide
some comments and guidance about what kind of impact we think that MFP will affect
us by. As far as categories around the store, digitally and physically, We are always
watching changes in subcategories, what's growing.

Our team starts every Monday talking about customer experiences and unit growth in
particular. So as we enter or potentially enter a period where invation is lower or higher,
it doesn't really matter to us. We'll manage the commodities as they come through.
We'll focus on the lowest prices we can focus on. We had 6,200 rollbacks in Walmart
US this quarter. Up about 23% from a year ago. So we'll just continue to focus on low
prices, but as category shift, categories grow, or they slow, our team will be very
reactive in terms of being able to be ready for customers wherever they're looking.
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey:
John David Rainey: Yeah. And on GLP one, I just some of the impacts that you would
that we see to our business are as you would expect. So as an example, we see that
fresh is a big driver, one of the big things in baskets. The unique thing about fresh is
that it's a basket driver. When someone buys fresh items, the baskets tend to be larger
by a double digit percentage. So when you take all of the puts and takes related to that,
it you know, it's kind of a wash. It doesn't really isn't a big driver of our growth one way
or the other.

Chris Nicholas:
Chris Nicholas:
Chris Nicholas:
Chris Nicholas: I'm thrilled to be in international. It's kind of a homecoming for me
because I started out in international when I joined. And there's lots of words you could
use to describe international, but if I was to choose one it would be growth, I think
growth is the top line, growth in the bottom line, the so much opportunity globally. And
as we think about all of the words we've used today, build one scale globally, AI helping
accelerate that, a platform centric approach, the ability to take the magic of the culture,
great assets that we've got internationally, and leverage platforms, gives us the
opportunity to do something we haven't been able to do before.
Latrice Watkins:
Latrice Watkins:
Latrice Watkins:
Latrice Watkins: Good morning. It's Latrice. I am thrilled also a homecoming to be
back at Sam's Club. And what I've felt in the time there is the energy and the
momentum of the business both with our associates and with our members. So, being
in clubs with members and associates has been a thrill We can see how they love
items. We can see how they love to shop. And I'm excited about the opportunity to
serve them. The way they wanna be served with great merchandise at great value. As
fast as they want it, either from our clubs or as they use the mechanisms we have in

Dave Gagina:
Dave Gagina:
Dave Gagina: Thanks for the question, Joe. Know, Qrst, I wanna take the opportunity to
thank the Walmart US associates in our stores, our supply chain, our home occe, for
delivering a fantastic quarter. US achieved 4.6% comp sales with proQts growing faster
than sales. As John mentioned earlier, I've spent the majority of my career in
ecommerce and logistics. And one feeling I've had the last few weeks is I'm humbled.
I'm humbled to learn from and serve 1,500,000 associates across Walmart US, and I
am energized by what I've seen in my Qrst few weeks.
I've been in stores in California, Texas, Florida, visited a distribution center in Florida
that is delivering fully palletized loads to all of the over 120 stores that it serves. And
then last week, I was with the Walmart US leadership team at the year beginning
meeting. And what's clear to me is that we are operating from a position of strength
and the opportunity ahead of us is signiQcant. We're investing with conQdence in
automation, new stores, remodels, our marketplace, membership, advertising, and all
of this. Will strengthen the customer experience, It's going to drive productivity. It's
going to improve our economics over time. And I am excited about the runway ahead.

John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner: No surprises, Rupesh. In fact, I'm really pleased with the fourth quarter.
John David mentioned the credit card offer. You asked about that. That's been strong.
Really pleased with the number of sign ups. The usage rate of the beneQts has been
fantastic. One of the fastest growing beneQts, obviously, with free shipping is the
express delivery and fast delivery services. That was up 60% year on year. And we just
we are really excited about the proposition. Having Walmart Plus with Seth DeLayer
move to an enterprise level, we see room to expand this into more markets in The
United States, and we're working on those plans. But overall, membership in Walmart

has been strong.
Sam's Club also had great results with membership in the quarter. We see continued
momentum there, which should include Sam's Club in The United States and Sam's
Club in China. We talked about that earlier. So really strength across all these areas.
The other thing I'd say about membership is it does give us a chance to serve
customers really frequently. Again, when you combine membership with the work we're
doing with Agenda Commerce, whether that's with Sparky, or partnerships with
Alphabet or OpenAI, it just gives us more ways be able to understand the best way that
our customers and our members wanna be served.

John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner:
John Furner: Yeah. Thanks, everyone, for the time and the investment and time in
Walmart today. Great to have you on the call. I just wanna close by saying we have a
clear strategy, and that's an omni strategy. It's working in The United States, it's
working around the world. It's working in The United States, it's working around the
world. We see a lot of opportunity to expand what we've built to serve customers
better, both here in this country and around the world. We have a great team. This is a
real experienced leadership team. You heard from a number of those people today.
And while they're new in new in their roles, I can tell you each and every one of them
care about our associates. They care about our culture. They wanna grow, and they're
really experienced at the things they do. So I have a lot of conQdence in this team as
we look ahead. Our capital strategy I'm also really pleased with investments that we've
made. We'll continue to remain disciplined. How we invest capital. John David said it
earlier, every dollar will compete for the best returns. That is true and will remain true.
And then Qnally, I just wanna thank our associates all around the world, over 2,000,000
people who are really hard each and every day to serve our customers. They're the
ones that make all this happen. Our people really do make the difference. And I'm
looking forward to a great year in getting out to the markets and meeting more of our
people.
